# Getting started with the terminal

Visual Studio Code includes a fully-featured integrated terminal. The integated terminal can run commands like `mkdir`, `ls`, and `git`, just like a standalone terminal. It also provides integration with the editor to support features such as links to workspace files or error detection.

The integrated terminal can use various shells installed on your machine. A shell is a program that interprets and executes the commands by interacting with the operating system. Examples of shells include Bash, Z shell, and PowerShell.

This tutorial guides you through the basics of using the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code.
