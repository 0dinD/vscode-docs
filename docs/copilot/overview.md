# GitHub Copilot in VS Code

The [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) extension is an AI pair programmer tool that helps you write code faster and smarter. You can use the Copilot extension in Visual Studio Code to generate code, learn from the code it generates, and even configure your editor.

With GitHub Copilot in VS Code you can:

* Get inline code suggestions while you're writing and iterating on code.
* Start a chat conversation to generate or refactor source code, produce documentation comments, or generate unit tests.
* Get help with fixing errors in your code, or resolve error while running commands in the terminal.
* Ask questions to help ramp-up on a new code base, or accelerate learning a new programming language or framework.
* Use chat features to discover and configure your VS Code setup.
