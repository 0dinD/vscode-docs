# GitHub Copilot subscriptions

If you want to use GitHub Copilot, you either need an active subscription for GitHub Copilot in your personal account, or you need to be assigned a seat in a subscription managed by an organization or enterprise.

Once you have access to a Copilot subscription, sign into Visual Studio Code with the same GitHub ID that has access to GitHub Copilot.

## Set up GitHub Copilot for your personal account

For your personal account, you can set up a subscription to **GitHub Copilot Individual**. Before starting a paid subscription for a personal account, you can [set up a one-time 30-day trial to evaluate GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/managing-your-github-copilot-individual-subscription#setting-up-a-github-copilot-trial-or-subscription-for-your-personal-account).

With GitHub Copilot Individual, you get access to GitHub Copilot in an IDE, or on the command line. Take advantage of autocomplete-style suggestions, or use a chat interface that lets you ask and receive answers to coding-related questions.

Your GitHub Copilot Individual subscription is associated with your personal GitHub account. You can manage your Copilot subscription in the [GitHub Copilot settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot).

## Set up GitHub Copilot within an organization

**GitHub Copilot Business** is a GitHub Copilot subscription, billed and administered at the organization level. Organization owners can manage policies for the use of GitHub Copilot within the organization. For example, to enable specific Copilot features, or to allow suggestions matching public code. Learn how to [set up a GitHub Copilot Business subscription](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/managing-your-github-copilot-business-subscription) for your organization.

If you are a member of an organization or enterprise with a GitHub Copilot subscription, to use the subscription, you need to be assigned a seat by an organization owner. You can request access to GitHub Copilot Business from your organization's owners. This can be done in a couple of different ways:

- From the [GitHub Copilot settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot) for your personal account

- From an empty repository in the organization

Organization owners can [administer access to Copilot for teams and individuals](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-for-copilot-in-your-organization) within the organization.

Organization owners can also access usage data relating to GitHub Copilot in their organization, and use that data to make informed decisions about seat assignment.

## Access your Copilot subscription in VS Code

To use GitHub Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code, you must be signed into Visual Studio Code with the same GitHub ID that has access to GitHub Copilot.

If you have not previously authorized Visual Studio Code in your GitHub account, you are prompted to sign in to GitHub in Visual Studio Code. If you have previously authorized Visual Studio Code in your GitHub account, GitHub Copilot is automatically authorized.

If your Copilot subscription is associated with another GitHub account, you might have to sign out of your GitHub account and sign in with another account. Use the **Accounts** menu in the Activity bar for signing out of your current GitHub account.
