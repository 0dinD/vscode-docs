## Accessibility

### Resize table columns via the keyboard

A new command, `list.resizeColumn`, enables you to resize columns by using the keyboard. For instance, you could apply this to columns in the Keyboard Shortcuts editor.

<video src="images/1_93/resize-columns.mp4" title="Resize columns in the Keyboard Shortcuts editor via the keyboard." autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Screen reader support for `accessibility.voice.autoSynthesize`

We've updated the <a href="vscode://settings/accessibility.voice.autoSynthesize" codesetting="true">`accessibility.voice.autoSynthesize`</a> setting to enable screen reader users to opt-in to hearing chat responses announced by our synthesizer, instead of getting aria alerts.

### Debugging improvements

When you're debugging with the focus in an editor, invoking the **Debug: Add to Watch** command now announces the variable's value for screen reader users.

Additionally, the Debug accessibility help dialog was improved for better thoroughness.

## Workbench

### New Profiles Editor (GA)

The new Profiles Editor is now generally available for all in Visual Studio Code. The new Profiles Editor enables you to manage profiles from a single place. This experience includes creating new profiles, editing and deleting existing profiles, and importing and exporting profiles to share with others. For more information, see the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/profiles).

![Profiles Editor](images/1_93/profiles-editor.png)

### Linux support for Window Control Overlays

A new setting <a href="vscode://settings/window.experimentalControlOverlay" codesetting="true">`window.experimentalControlOverlay`</a> enables native window controls to appear, even when a custom title bar is enabled via the <a href="vscode://settings/window.titleBarStyle" codesetting="true">`window.titleBarStyle`</a> setting.

![Linux window control overlays.](images/1_93/linux-wco.png)

Out of the box, we have not yet enabled custom title by default on Linux, but we plan to do so eventually. Once you turn on a custom title, native window control overlays will appear automatically. We welcome any feedback you find when using this new feature!

### Comments sorting

Comments can be sorted by position in file or by date.

![Comment sorting options](images/1_93/comment-sorting-options.png)

### "Copy URL" from Settings Editor

You can copy a direct URL to a specific setting from the settings editor.

![Copy setting URL](images/1_93/copy-setting-url.gif)

## Editor

## Languages

### Renamed "SQL" to "MS SQL"

The language name for SQL files has been renamed from "SQL" to "MS SQL" to better reflect the language's focus on Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL) syntax. The file extension for this language mode is still `.sql` and the syntax highlighting is still the same.

### New YAML Grammar

We've adopted a new, better maintained, grammar for YAML syntax highlighting. This new grammar solves some bugs that the old, unmaintained, grammar had.

## Source Control

### Source Control Graph view

Based on user feedback, we have moved the history graph that was enabled last milestone from the Source Control view into a new view called **Source Control Graph**. This reduces the information overload from the main view and enables you to hide/collapse/move the new view as you see fit. This also lays the foundation for a full-featured history graph.

The Source Control Graph view currently shows the remote/base for the current branch. In the next milestone, we are working on adding the capability to filter the graph to any repository reference, and improving the experience workspaces with multiple repositories.

![Source Control Graph view showing a graph visualization of the repository.](images/1_93/scm-graph.png)

_Theme: [GitHub Sharp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joaomoreno.github-sharp-theme) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/joaomoreno.github-sharp-theme))_

### Support for "reftable" format

[Git 2.45](https://github.blog/open-source/git/highlights-from-git-2-45/#preliminary-reftable-support) added preliminary support for the new reference storage backend called "reftable". This milestone, we updated the built-in Git extension to support this new reference storage backend.

Using Git 2.45, you can either create or clone a repository that uses the new reference storage backend with the `--ref-format=reftable` flag. Git 2.46 also added support for migrating an existing repository to use the new reference storage format by using the [`git refs migrate`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-refs/2.46.0) command.

Please note that the new reference storage backend is still considered experimental.

### Compact folders setting

Thanks to a community contribution, we have added a new setting, <a href="vscode://settings/scm.compactFolders" codesetting="true">`scm.compactFolders`</a>, to control whether folders are rendered in compact form in the Source Control view when changes are viewed as a tree.

## Terminal

### Julia and NuShell support

There's now shell integration support for Julia and NuShell. This enables features such as [command decorations](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_command-decorations-and-the-overview-ruler) and [run recent command](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_run-recent-command) for these shell types.

### Support moving multiple terminal tabs

You can now multi-select terminal tabs and move them around the list as an ordered group.

### Command guide setting and theme key

You can now disable the [command guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_command-guide) with the <a href="vscode://settings/terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.showCommandGuide" codesetting="true">`terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.showCommandGuide`</a> setting and the color can be configured by themes with the `terminalCommandGuide.foreground` theme key.

## Notebooks

### Sticky Scrolling for Notebook Execution Count

The execution count of a code cell will now stick to the bottom of the screen when scrolling down a code cell. This makes it easier to see the execution state and update when working in a long code cell.

<video src="images/1_93/notebook_execution_count_sticky_scroll.mp4" title="Notebook execution count remain visible during scrolling" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Support to show/hide leading & trailing whitespace in the diff view

The notebook diff view now respects the following setting:

* <a href="vscode://settings/diffEditor.ignoreTrimWhitespace" codesetting="true">`diffEditor.ignoreTrimWhitespace`</a> - Ignore leading and trailing (trim) whitespace when showing differences.

![notebook_diff_whitespace](images/1_93/notebook_diff_whitespace.gif)

### Support to show/hide unchanged cells in the diff view

The notebook diff view now hides unchanged cells, enabling users to focus on the changed cells.
At the same time, the input of all unchanged cells is always collapsed.

![notebook_diff_unchanged.gif](images/1_93/notebook_diff_unchanged.gif)




## Tasks

### Keep task terminal open on process exit

If a task's terminal process exits with a non-zero code, we now keep the terminal open for easier debugging.

## Debug

### Find control

You can now open the Find control in the Debug Console (`kb(repl.action.find)`) to search for results in the input. Support for searching results in the output will be investigated in future milestones.

You can also access the control via the action `Debug Console: Focus Find` that appears on the Debug Console's toolbar to the right of the Filter control.

## Testing


## Languages

## Installer

The Debian package now prompts you to confirm whether you want to add the [packages.microsoft.com](https://packages.microsoft.com) repository. This enables you to update the package afterwards by using apt.

![Terminal showing the prompt for adding the Microsoft packages repo during the install.](images/1_93/debian-debconf-pmc-ask.png)

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO @ntrogh: add remote highlights here

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_93.md).

## VS Code for the Web

The <a href="vscode://settings/git.openDiffOnClick" codesetting="true">`git.openDiffOnClick`</a> setting is now honored when browsing a GitHub repository on [https://vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) or on the desktop with the [GitHub Repositories extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.remotehub).

![Open diff by clicking on Open Changes for changed resources.](images/1_93/git-diff-click.gif)

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### Start debugging from Chat

A new experimental slash command, `/startDebugging`, is available on the `@vscode` chat participant. This command enables you to create a launch configuration and start debugging your app.

To opt-in and enable `/startDebugging`, turn on the <a href="vscode://settings/github.copilot.advanced.startDebugging.experimental.enabled" codesetting="true">`github.copilot.advanced.startDebugging.experimental.enabled`</a> setting.

You can also access this command through the `Generate Debug Configuration with GitHub Copilot` option in the Create a launch.json Quick Pick.

![Generate Debug Configuration with GitHub Copilot is an option in the Create a launch.json file Quick Pick.](images/1_93/startDebugging.png)

#### Automatic chat participant detection in Chat view

GitHub Copilot has built-in chat participants, such as `@workspace`, which also contribute commands to the Chat view. Previously, you had to explicitly specify the chat participant and command in a chat prompt.

To make it easier to leverage chat participants with natural language, in the coming weeks, we're experimenting with enabling Copilot Chat to automatically route your question to a suitable participant or chat command.

![Participant detection in Chat view](images/1_93/participant-detection.png)

If the automatically-selected participant is not appropriate for your question, you can select the `rerun without` button at the top of the chat response to resend your question.

You can manually enable or disable this feature by configuring the <a href="vscode://settings/chat.experimental.detectParticipant.enabled" codesetting="true">`chat.experimental.detectParticipant.enabled`</a> setting.

#### Attach Context in Quick Chat

When using Quick Chat, you can now use the `Attach Context` action to attach context like files and symbol to your Copilot request.

![Attach context in Quick Chat.](images/1_93/attach-context-quick-chat.gif)

#### Improvements to chat history

You can open previous chat sessions from the chat history with the **Show Chats** button at the top of the Chat view. These sessions now have a more user-friendly, AI-generated name. You can also rename sessions manually by selecting the pencil icon on each row.

![The chat history picker.](images/1_93/chat-history.png)

These chat history entries are now also sorted by the date of their last request, and are labeled with their age.

> Note: Only new chat sessions get the AI-generated name, any chat sessions that you already had won't be renamed.

#### Chats saved in empty windows

Previously, VS Code wasn't saving chat sessions for empty windows (that don't have a folder or workspace open). Now, these sessions are saved as expected, and previous chats from an empty window can be loaded via the **Show Chats** button.

> **Note**: You should avoid opening and using the same chat session in multiple empty windows simultaneously.

#### Thumbs down details

Did you get a response from Copilot Chat that isn't what you expected? Help us out by selecting the **Thumbs down** button on the toolbar for a chat response. Now, it shows a dropdown with a few detailed options for you to describe the issue. You can also open the issue reporter from this menu.

![A dropdown showing extra details on the thumbs down button.](images/1_93/thumbs-down.png)

#### Preview: Inline Chat from Current Line

You can now start inline chat and use the current line as prompt. There are three ways to do this

1. Use "F1 > Inline Chat: Start in Editor with Current Line"
1. Configure a keybinding for the `inlineChat.startWithCurrentLine` command, combine it with the `inlineChatExpansion` context key
1. Enable the `github.copilot.editor.enableInlineChatCompletionTrigger`-setting so that Copilot makes suggest to start inline chat once a line consists of mostly text and not source code.

The recording below shows how Copilot suggests to start inline chat once a line consists of mostly text and not source code.

<video src="images/1_93/inline-with-line.mp4" title="Start Inline Chat via Completions" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

#### Preview: Inline Chat with Temporal Context

Inline chat can now use recently seen or edited code as context. This is currently experimental but also good to be tested by everyone. You can enable it via the `github.copilot.chat.experimental.temporalContext.enabled`-setting.

### Python

#### Django unit test support

We are excited to announce support for one of our most [requested features](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/73): you can now  discover and run Django unit tests through the Test Explorer! For set up instructions on how to enable this functionality, [check our documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing#_django-unit-tests).

![Django unit tests discovered and run in the Test Explorer.](images/1_93/django-unittests.png)
_Theme: [Catppuccin Macchiato](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Catppuccin.catppuccin-vsc) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/Catppuccin.catppuccin-vsc/Catppuccin%20Macchiato))_

As you explore this newly added feature, please provide feedback and report any issues in our [vscode-python repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues) or by using the **Python: Report Issue** command.

#### Native REPL improvements

We made more improvements and bug fixes to the new Native REPL experience. We are rolling out the native REPL as the default target for [Smart Send](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-november-2023-release/#improvements-to-shift-enter-run-line-in-terminal) as an experiment, but if you are interested in trying this out, you can set <a href="vscode://settings/python.REPL.sendToNativeREPL" codesetting="true">`python.REPL.sendToNativeREPL`</a> in your User `settings.json` and reload your VS Code window.

#### Go to definition from inlay hints with Pylance

When [inlay hints are enabled](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/settings-reference#_intellisense-engine-settings) with Pylance, you can now more conveniently navigate to a type's definition by hovering over it and clicking while holding `kbstyle(Ctrl)` on Windows and Linux or `kbstyle(Cmd)` on macOS:

![Go to Definition supported by using Ctrl/Cmd + click when hovering over a Python type on an inlay hint.](images/1_93/pylance-gotodef-inlayhints.png)

#### Restart support when debugging tests

You can now restart the debugger when debugging tests through the Debug toolbar control.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

There has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which enables you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. Review the [changelog for the 0.96.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0960) release of the extension to learn about the highlights.

## Extension authoring

### Terminal shell integration API

The terminal shell integration API is now available to use. This powerful API enables an extension to listen to commands run in terminals, read their raw output, exit code and command lines.

```ts
window.onDidEndTerminalShellExecution(event => {
    if (event.execution.commandLine.value.startsWith('git')) {
        if (event.exitCode === 0) {
            // React to a successful git command
        } else {
            // React to a failing git command
        }
    }
});
```

It also provides a more reliable way to execute a command, which will wait for a prompt to start before sending the command, preventing the command to be echoed to the terminal an extra time.

```ts
const commandLine = 'echo "Hello world"';
if (term.shellIntegration) {
    const execution = shellIntegration.executeCommand({ commandLine });
    window.onDidEndTerminalShellExecution(event => {
        if (event.execution === execution) {
            console.log(`Command exited with code ${event.exitCode}`);
        }
    });
} else {
    term.sendText(commandLine);
    // Without shell integration, we can't know when the command has finished or what the
    // exit code was.
}
```

See the API in `vscode.d.ts` and [the extension sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/shell-integration-sample) for more information.

### Authentication account API

The authentication APIs now have more control when handling multiple accounts. Something that has always been missing is the ability to get all accounts and get an `AuthenticationSession` for a specific account. That is now possible with the finalization of the `getAccounts` API.

Extension authors looking to consume authentication sessions can run the following code to get the `AuthenticationSessionAccountInformation` of the accounts that the user is logged into:

```ts
const accounts = vscode.authentication.getAccounts('microsoft');
```

From there, you can use those accounts to mint sessions specifically for those accounts:

```ts
const session = vscode.authentication.getSession('microsoft', scopes, { account: accounts[0] })
```

> **Note**: For this to work, the authentication provider needs to handle a parameter that is passed in to both `getSessions` and `createSession`. The built-in GitHub and Microsoft providers have already adopted this.

We believe that this is the clearest way to handle multiple authentication sessions and also handle various scenarios that we couldn't support before.

## WebAssemblies in VS Code

The 1.0 versions of the `wasm-wasi-core` extension together with the `@vscode-wasm-wasi` and `@vscode/wasm-component-model` npm modules have been released. Usage samples can be found in the [vscode-extension-samples](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples) repository in the `wasm-*` sub folders. There are also several posts about how to use WebAssembly code inside a VS Code extension on the [VS Code blog](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs).

## Preview Features

### Terminal IntelliSense improvements

[Experimental PowerShell IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_experimental-intellisense-for-powershell) got the following improvements this release:

- `git checkout` now includes a completion for `-` to switch to the previous branch.
- The default value for `terminal.integrated.suggest.runOnEnter` is now set to ignore, which means `kbstyle(Enter)` does not interact at all with IntelliSense. This was feedback from users who found the impact on muscle memory too disruptive.
- PowerShell keywords are now available as completions for the command (not args).
- The `cd` first directory suggestion is now always itself which makes things smoother when `terminal.integrated.suggest.runOnEnter` is set.
  ![cd into docs will present docs as the top result](images/1_93/terminal_cd_self_dir.png)
- Suggestions are more consistent now when requested at different positions on the command line.
- A completion is provided for `<path>/../` when navigating back directories.
  ![cd ..\\ will give a suggestion for ..\\..\\](images/1_93/terminal_suggest_dotdot.png)

### Conpty shipping in product

Conpty is the backend for the terminal that emulates how pseudoterminals work on other operating systems. This component is shipped in Windows itself, which means that bug fixes are released via Windows Update. Users may end up waiting a very long time for these fixes to arrive.

This release, we have an experimental setting that bundles conpty with VS Code itself, similar to how Windows Terminal does it. This means that users can get bug fixes as we ship updates to VS Code instead of waiting on Windows updates.

To enable this, set the following setting to `true`:

```json
"terminal.integrated.experimental.windowsUseConptyDll": true
```

The type of improvements you should expect for enabling this are:

- Better performance
- More reliable shell integration
- More escape sequence support (for example [sixel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixel) support on Windows soon)

The only currently known issue is that some users have a process that sticks around and blocks VS Code updates ([microsoft/vscode#225719](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/225719)), which requires manually killing the process to enable updates.

## Proposed APIs

### Tools for language models

We continue to iterate on our `LanguageModelTool` API. The API comes with two major parts:

1. The ability for extensions to register a *tool*. A tool is a piece of functionality that is meant to be used by language models. For example, reading the Git history of a file.

2. The mechanics for language models to support tools, such as extensions passing tools when making a request, language models requesting a tool invocation, and extensions communicating back the result of a tool invocation.

One of the changes this month adds is the ability for the user to manually attach certain tools to their chat request. An example of this would be for a tool that computes some dynamic context that the user wants to use in their request.

The proposal can be found as [vscode.proposed.lmTools.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.lmTools.d.ts). Check out the [`tool-user` sample extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/roblou/tool-user) that demonstrates registering and calling tools.

Watch [issue #213274](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/213274) for updates or to give us feedback.

> **Note**: The API is still under active development, and things will change.

## Chat participant detection API

If you're authoring an extension that contributes participants or chat commands to the panel chat view, you can enable your participants and commands to be automatically detected by adding metadata to your `chatParticipants` contribution in `package.json`. We have updated the `vscode-extension-samples` repo with [examples](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/blob/d4c646fa3cf6d8ca060aa6c7806c0543d0011de8/chat-sample/package.json#L27-L57) of how you can adopt this API. When testing, be sure to set <a href="vscode://settings/chat.experimental.detectParticipant.enabled" codesetting="true">`chat.experimental.detectParticipant.enabled`</a>. Please note that this is a proposed API that is subject to change.

## Website

We have fixed several links under the [VS Code API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api) page. Links to generic types and functions work again, and primitive types and values aren't formatted as links anymore!

## Engineering

### Progress on using ESM for VS Code

During this milestone, we completed the majority of the work to adopt ESM for VS Code Core. Our goal is to use ECMAScript Modules (ESM) loading and drop AMD entirely. We will start to release ESM-enabled Insider builds in September and plan to ship ESM to stable for our next Stable release in October.

## Notable fixes

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
