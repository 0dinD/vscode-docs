## Accessibility

### Screen reader support for `accessibility.voice.autoSynthesize`

We've modified <a href="vscode://settings/accessibility.voice.autoSynthesize" codesetting="true">`accessibility.voice.autoSynthesize`</a> so that screen reader users can opt-in to hearing chat responses announced with our synthesizer vs aria alerts when a request is made via speech.

## Editor


## Source Control

## Notebooks

## Support to show/hide leading & trailing whitespace in the diff view
The notebook diff view now respects the following setting
* `diffEditor.ignoreTrimWhitespace` - Ignore leading and trailing (trim) whitespace when showing differences.

## Support to show/hide unchanged cells in the diff view
The notebook diff view now hides unchanged cells, allowing users to focus on the changed cells.
At the same time, the input of all unchanged cells is always collapsed.

#### Start debugging from Chat

A new slash command on the `@vscode` chat participant, `/startDebugging`, enables you to create launch confiuration and start debugging your app.

An entry point to this command is also provided in the create launch.json quickpick via `Generate Debug Configuration with GitHub Copilot`.
