## Accessibility

### Resize table columns via the keyboard

A new command, `list.resizeColumn`, enables users to resize columns using the keyboard. For instance, this can be applied to columns in the keybindings editor.

### Screen reader support for `accessibility.voice.autoSynthesize`

We've updated the <a href="vscode://settings/accessibility.voice.autoSynthesize" codesetting="true">`accessibility.voice.autoSynthesize`</a> setting, allowing screen reader users to opt-in to hearing chat responses announced by our synthesizer instead of aria alerts when a request is made via speech.

### Debugging improvements

When debugging with focus in an editor, invoking Debug: Add to Watch now announces the variable's value to screen reader users.

Additionally, the Debug Accessibility Help Dialog has been improved for better thoroughness.

## Workbench


## Editor


## Source Control


## Terminal

### Support moving multiple terminal tabs

You can now multi-select terminal tabs and move them around the list as an ordered group.

### Command guide setting and theme key

TODO@Tyriar: terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.showCommandGuide setting and terminalCommandGuide.foreground theme key https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/224469

## Notebooks

## Support to show/hide leading & trailing whitespace in the diff view
The notebook diff view now respects the following setting
* `diffEditor.ignoreTrimWhitespace` - Ignore leading and trailing (trim) whitespace when showing differences.

## Support to show/hide unchanged cells in the diff view
The notebook diff view now hides unchanged cells, allowing users to focus on the changed cells.
At the same time, the input of all unchanged cells is always collapsed.

## Tasks

### Keep task terminal open on process exit

If a task's terminal process exits with a non-zero code, we will now keep the terminal open to allow for easier debugging.

## Debug

### Find widget

You can now open the find widget in the debug console (`kb(repl.action.find)`) to search for results in the input. Support for searching results in the output will be investigated in future iterations.

The widget can also be accessed via the action `Debug Console: Focus Find` that appears on the debug console's toolbar to the right of the filter widget.

## Testing


## Languages

## Installation

The Debian package now prompts the user to confirm whether they want to add the [packages.microsoft.com](https://packages.microsoft.com) repository so that they can update the package with apt afterwards.

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### Start debugging from Chat

A new experimental slash command, `/startDebugging`, is available on the `@vscode` chat participant. This command allows you to create a launch configuration and start debugging your app. To opt-in and enable `/startDebugging`, turn on the <a href="vscode://settings/github.copilot.advanced.startDebugging.experimental.enabled" codesetting="true">`github.copilot.advanced.startDebugging.experimental.enabled`</a> setting.

You can also access this command through the `Generate Debug Configuration with GitHub Copilot` option in the create launch.json quickpick.
