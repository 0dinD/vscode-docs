## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO: add remote highlights here

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_90.md).

### VS Code Speech

We added support for text-to-speech capabilities to the [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) extension. A new setting <code codesetting="accessibility.voice.autoSynthesize">accessibility.voice.autoSynthesize</code> can be enabled to automatically read out aloud Copilot Chat responses when voice was used as input:

<video src="images/1_90/text-to-speech.mp4" title="Text to Speech in Copilot Chat" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

Notice how the microphone icon in the input field changes to an icon indicating that text is read out aloud. Clicking that icon will stop the synthesis, or you can use the new `kb(workbench.action.speech.stopReadAloud)` command.

Each Chat response shows a new speaker icon so that you can selectively read out a response aloud:

![Text to Speech for a Chat Response](images/1_90/text-to-speech.png)

You can change the language used for reading aloud via the existing <code codesetting="accessibility.voice.speechLanguage">accessibility.voice.speechLanguage</code> setting.

### Tracking memory efficiency on startup

We measure startup performance of VS Code insiders every day across Windows, macOS and Linux. Our main interest is how fast startup is until a text file is opened.

This month we added another metric that we plan to improve to make startup even faster: how much memory do we consume and how much of that memory ends up being garbage collected by V8. If we can bring that number down, startup time will be less affected by V8 garbage collection runs.

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
