## Accessibility

### Set keybindings from the accessibility help dialog

Accessibility help dialogs give you an overview of important commands that can be taken for a feature or view. When a command lacks a keybinding assignment, you can now configure it from within the accessibility help dialog with `kb(editor.action.accessibilityHelpConfigureKeybindings)`.

### Experimental signal delay settings

When the setting <code codesetting="accessibility.signalOptions.debouncePositionChanges">Debounce position changes</code> is enabled, you can use the setting <code codesetting="accessibility.signalOptions.delays">Signal options delays</code> to customize the debouncing time for various accessibility signals.

## Workbench

### Editor tabs multi-select

You can now select multiple tabs simultaneously, enabling you to apply actions to multiple editors at once. This new feature enables you to move, pin, or close several tabs with a single action. To add another tab to your selection, use `Ctrl + Click` (`Cmd + Click` on macOS). To select a range of tabs, use `Shift + Click`.

<video src="images/1_90/tabs-multi-select.mp4" title="Select multiple tabs and move/close them" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Always show editor actions

We are introducing the <code codesetting="workbench.editor.alwaysShowEditorActions">Always Show Editor Actions</code> setting. When you enable this setting, the editor title actions of each editor group are always shown.

When the setting is not enabled (default value), the editor actions are only shown when the editor is active:

![Editor Actions of each group when the setting is disabled](images/1_90/editor-actions-default.png)

If you enable the setting, the editor actions are always shown, regardless of whether the editor is active or not:

![Editor Actions of each group when the setting is enabled](images/1_90/editor-actions-always.png)

### disable-lcd-text now supported as a runtime argument

With `diable-lcd-text`, you can disable RGB subpixel rendering on Windows. The `disable-lcd-text` setting is now supported as a runtime argument in the `argv.json` file. Previously, it was only available as an undocumented CLI flag.

In the following image you can see a side-by-side comparison, where on the left side `disable-lcd-text` is enabled, and on the right side it is disabled.

![Comparison showing that disable-lcd-text disables RGB subpixel rendering](images/1_90/disable-lcd-text.png)

_Theme: [Light Pink](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgwg.light-pink-theme) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/mgwg.light-pink-theme))_

### Configure custom profile for new window

You can now configure a custom [profile](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/profiles) for a new window with the <code codesetting="window.newWindowProfile">window.newWindowProfile</code> setting. This setting enables you to specify a profile that is used when you open a new window.

![Configure custom profile for new window](images/1_90/profile-new-window.png)

## Editor


## Source Control

### Focus input/resource group commands

This milestone, we have added several workbench commands, which you could bind to a keyboard shortcut:

- Focus on the next or previous source control input field: `workbench.scm.action.focusNextInput`, `workbench.scm.action.focusPreviousInput`
- Focus on the next or previous resource group within a repository: `workbench.scm.action.focusNextResourceGroup`, `workbench.scm.action.focusPreviousResourceGroup`

## Notebooks

### Find in Cell Selection

Users can now use the find widget to search within specific ranges of selected cells when within a notebook. The "Find in Cell Selection" toggle can be seen in the Notebook Find widget by setting the <code codesetting="notebook.experimental.find.scope.enabled">notebook.experimental.find.scope.enabled</code> setting to `true`. After doing this, a cell selection can be applied to the notebook search by selecting a range of cells then either opening the find widget, or if already open, selecting the "Find in Cell Selection" button.

<video src="images/1_90/notebook-find-in-cell-selection.mp4" title="Notebook Find in Cell Selection" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Notebook Format Code Actions

Notebooks now support a new kind of Code Action defined with the Code Action Kind prefix `notebook.format`. These Code Actions can automatically be triggered via an explicit formatting request (using the command **Notebook: Format Notebook**) or a formatting on save request. These can be used to provide more powerful formatting, via the use of Workspace Edits and Notebook Edits. An example extension can be seen in the [vscode-extension-samples](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/notebook-format-code-action-sample) repository, which can be useful in guiding development.

## Terminal

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Removal of the canvas renderer

The canvas renderer was deprecated in the VS Code 1.89 release and is now removed completely. This means that on the small number of machines that do not support WebGL2, the terminal now uses the DOM-based renderer. You can read more about GPU acceleration in the [terminal documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/appearance#_gpu-acceleration).

### Rescaling overlapping glyph in the terminal

The setting <code codesetting="terminal.integrated.rescaleOverlappingGlyphs">terminal.integrated.rescaleOverlappingGlyphs</code> that was introduced as a preview feature in the VS Code 1.88 release is now enabled by default. This feature rescales glyphs that overlap following cells that are intended to cover ambiguous width characters, and which might have font glyphs that don't match what the backing pty/unicode version thinks it is. For example, in most fonts the roman numeral unicode characters (`U+2160+`) typically takes up multiple cells, so they are rescaled horizontally when this setting is enabled.

Without rescaling:

![Before the glyphs for ‚Öß and ‚Ö´ depending on the font would always overlap the following cells](images/1_88/terminal-glyphs-before.png)

With rescaling:

![After the glyphs for ‚Öß and ‚Ö´ depending on the font are rescaled horizontally to fit a single cell](images/1_88/terminal-glyphs-after.png)

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### Attach context to chat

You can now attach more types of context to a chat message, such as files or workspace symbols. In the Chat view input field, select the üìé icon or type `kb(workbench.action.chat.attachContext)` to choose from available context types. You can use the right arrow key to quickly attach context in the background while you keep the context picker open. When you're in the editor, you can also right click on a selection and choose **Copilot > Add Selection to Chat**.

<video src="images/1_90/chat-context-attachments.mp4" title="Attach context to chat" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

#### Ask questions using Bing search and enterprise knowledge bases

[GitHub Copilot Enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/github-copilot-enterprise/overview/about-github-copilot-enterprise) users in VS Code can now ask questions that are enriched with context from web results and your enterprise's [knowledge bases](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/github-copilot-enterprise/copilot-chat-in-github/managing-copilot-knowledge-bases).

To try out this functionality, install the latest pre-release of Copilot Chat. In the Chat view, you can then ask questions like `@github What is the latest LTS of Node.js? #web` to take advantage of web search. Any search results referenced by Copilot are displayed in the `Used References` section of the chat response.

![Web search results in Copilot Chat](images/1_90/copilot-enterprise-bing-search.png)

You can also ask questions about your enterprise's knowledge bases, which are collections of Markdown repositories containing documentation, directly from VS Code. Simply type `@github #kb` to pick from the knowledge bases available to you. Similarly, any knowledge base snippets referenced by Copilot are displayed in the `Used References` section of the chat response.

This enables Copilot Enterprise users to combine search results and internal documentation with editor context by using existing chat variables like `#file` and `#selection`. Please try it out and share your feedback with us at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release!

#### IntelliSense in chat code blocks

We now support basic IntelliSense within Copilot-generated code blocks to learn more about the generated code. This lets you use many of the same IntelliSense tools that might also use in the editor.

![Hover IntelliSense in Copilot chat code block](images/1_90/copilot-hover-intellisense.png)

The supported IntelliSense features include:

- Go to definition by using `kbstyle(ctrl)` `kbstyle(click)` / `kbstyle(cmd)` `kbstyle(click)` or `kb(editor.action.revealDefinition)`
- Hovers
- Go to implementation
- Go to type definition

IntelliSense can even be used with `@workspace` to learn about any workspace symbols that are used in Copilot responses.

<video src="images/1_90/copilot-workspace-intellisense.mp4" title="IntelliSense on a @workspace code block" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

IntelliSense for TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code blocks is available ou of the box. For additional language support, try installing an extension for that language, although at this time not every language extension currently supports code block IntelliSense. Please file feature requests for any languages that aren't supporting this yet.

#### Better links in chat responses

We now more create clickable links for file names and symbols that are used in chat responses:

![Clickable links for symbols used with /explain](images/1_90/copilot-link-explain.png)

![Clickable file and symbol links for an @workspace question](images/1_90/copilot-link-workspace.png)

Selecting these links takes you to the corresponding file or symbol.

#### Roam active chat between inline chat and Chat view

You can now move any chat request that is completed or still active from inline chat to the Chat view. You might use this feature to clean up inline chat and move conversations to a more persistent place. To move a request, select the chat icon next to the chat input box.

#### Automatic rename suggestions available for everyone

Copilot-powered rename suggestions are now triggered automatically when renaming a symbol for all Copilot Chat extension users. This can be turned off using a new setting <code codesetting="github.copilot.renameSuggestions.triggerAutomatically">github.copilot.renameSuggestions.triggerAutomatically</code>.

<video src="images/1_90/rename-suggestions.mp4" title="Automatically-triggered rename suggestions" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Python

The experience with pytest when using the Python Testing Rewrite has been improved to offer better support for setting pytest's cwd when it is adjacent to the VS Code workspace root, and for displaying parameterized tests on the test explorer when function names are repeated across classes. Additionally, we reduced some test discovery failure scenarios by adding the system configuration script path to PATH to enable shell for test execution.

#### Experimental: Python Native REPL with Intellisense and Syntax Highlighting

You can now run your Python code in an editor-like REPL environment equipped with features like Intellisense and syntax highlighting to make interactions with the REPL more efficient. To enable this feature, set `"python.REPL.sendToNativeREPL": true` in your `settings.json` file. This will execute code in the Python Native REPL on `kbstyle(Shift+Enter)` and **Run Selection/Line**.

You can opt to use the in-terminal Python REPL ( >>> ) by setting `"python.REPL.sendToNativeREPL": false` in your `settings.json`. Moreover, the Python Native REPL will smartly execute on `kbstyle(Enter)`, similar to Python‚Äôs original interactive interpreter, if you add the setting `"interactiveWindow.executeWithShiftEnter": false`, in your `settings.json`.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

There has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which enables you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. Review the [changelog for the 0.90.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0900) release of the extension to learn about the other highlights.

### VS Code Speech

We added support for text-to-speech capabilities to the [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) extension. A new setting <code codesetting="accessibility.voice.autoSynthesize">accessibility.voice.autoSynthesize</code> can be enabled to automatically read out aloud Copilot Chat responses when voice was also used as input.

<video src="images/1_90/text-to-speech.mp4" title="Text to Speech in Copilot Chat" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

Notice how the microphone icon in the input field changes to an icon indicating that text is read out aloud. To interrupt the synthesis, select the icon or use the new `kb(workbench.action.speech.stopReadAloud)` command.

Each chat response shows a new speaker icon so that you can selectively read out a response aloud:

![Text to Speech for a Chat Response](images/1_90/text-to-speech.png)

You can change the language that is used for text-to-speech via the existing <code codesetting="accessibility.voice.speechLanguage">accessibility.voice.speechLanguage</code> setting.

## Preview Features

### VS Code-native IntelliSense for PowerShell

In addition to reliability improvements, we made the following changes to PowerShell IntelliSense in the terminal:

- `terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.suggestEnabled` has changed to `terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled`
- The new `terminal.integrated.suggest.quickSuggestions` controls whether suggestions are shown when you type after whitespace
- The new `terminal.integrated.suggest.suggestOnTriggerCharacters` controls whether suggestions are shown when you type `/`, `\` or `-`

### TypeScript 5.5

We continued improving our support for the upcoming TypeScript 5.5 release. Check out the [TypeScript 5.5 beta blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-5-beta/) and [iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/57475) for details on this release.

To start using the TypeScript 5.5 beta, install the [TypeScript Nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next). Please share feedback and let us know if you run into any bugs with TypeScript 5.5.

### TypeScript Paste With imports

The new **Paste With Imports** feature automatically adds imports when you copy and paste code between two JavaScript or TypeScript files:

To enable this feature, make sure you are using TypeScript 5.5 in your workspace and then set `javascript.experimental.updateImportsOnPaste` or `typescript.experimental.updateImportsOnPaste`.

## Extension authoring

### esbuild for extensions

The `yo code` extension generators for `TypeScript` and `Web` now have an option to use `esbuild` as bundler. When selected will create a `esbuild.js` build script along with script entries in `package.json` and build tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json`.

To use esbuild in existing extensions check out the [bundling extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/bundling-extension.md) and the [web extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/web-extensions.md) guides.

A sample project can be found at [vscode-extension-samples/esbuild-sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/esbuild-sample).


### Chat and Language Model API

We have finalized APIs that enable extensions to participate in chat and to access language models. See the [extension sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/chat-sample) and the [chat extensions doc page](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/chat) for more information, or watch the [Enhancing VS Code extensions with GitHub Copilot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI7kjWzIiTM) talk we delivered at the Microsoft Build conference.

> ‚ÄºÔ∏è Please note that these APIs are finalized but currently only available in VS Code Insiders ‚ÄºÔ∏è

#### Chat Participants

The Chat Participants API enables extensions to extend GitHub Copilot Chat with a chat participant that can be invoked in the chat input field with `@`. The participant can reply to user requests with markdown, a file tree, buttons to run VS Code commands, or other types of content.

![chat participant example](images/1_90/chat-example.png)

#### Language Model

The Language Model API enables access to Copilot's chat models, such as gpt-3.5 and gpt-4. This API can be used for chat participants but also to enrich other features. The API is built around [`LanguageModelChat`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/54dd0ecc653b89e6032369c6f4b1808bc8e37ec5/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts#L19032) objects, which are used for chat requests and for counting tokens.

The only way to access chat objects is the `vscode.lm.selectChatModels` function. The function accepts a selector to narrow down on different properties of chat models, for example by vendor, family, version, or identifier. The values are relatively free-form and must be looked up in the documentation of the extensions that provide them. Today, only the Copilot Chat extension contributes chat models. It uses the `copilot` vendor and current families are `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4` but are subject to change.

The snippet shows how to select all chat models from the `copilot`-vendor:

```ts
const models = await vscode.lm.selectChatModels({
	vendor: 'copilot',
});

if(models.length === 0) {
	// no models available
	return;
}
```

Two things are very **important** when callng `selectChatModels`

1. The function returns an _empty_ array if no models are available and extensions must handle this case.
2. Copilot's chat models require consent from the user before an extension can use them. Consent is implemented as authentication dialog. Because of that, `selectChatModels` should be called as part of a user-initiated action like a command, and not "out of the blue".

With a chat object at hand, extensions can now use it to send chat requests. The following snippet shows how to send a chat request and process the response stream.

```ts
// take the first model and say "Hello"
const [chat] = models;
const messages = [vscode.LanguageModelChatMessage.User('Hello')];
const response = await chat.sendRequest(messages);

// the response is always an async iterable that can be consumed with for-await
for await (const part of response.text) {
	console.log(part)
}
```

This is the gist of the language model API. Head over to https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/chat-sample for a more complete example. Stay tuned for more samples, documentation, and further extensions of the API.

##### `@vscode/prompt-tsx` library

To aid with developing GitHub Copilot extensions for VS Code, we've developed and published a TSX-based library for declaring complex prompts and converting them to chat messages, subject to your LLM's context window limits. In developing this, we took inspiration from Anysphere's [`priompt`](https://github.com/anysphere/priompt) library. If you're an extension author who is planning to use the chat and language model APIs, consider trying out the latest alpha release of this library: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vscode/prompt-tsx

### Extending GitHub Copilot through GitHub Apps

It is also possible to extend GitHub Copilot by contributing a GitHub App. This GitHub App can contribute a chat participant in the Chat view, which you can invoke with `@`. A GitHub App is backed by a service and works across all GitHub Copilot surfaces, such as github.com, Visual Studio, or VS Code. GitHub Apps do not have full access to the VS Code API. To extend GitHub Copilot through a GitHub App, you should join the [Copilot Partner Program](https://github.com/features/preview/copilot-partner-program). You can learn more by watching the [Extending GitHub Copilot](https://build.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/0121ee70-fd82-419f-a7ad-75bbb70cfd41) talk we delivered at the Microsoft Build conference.

### Debug Stack Focus API

VS Code now exposes what stack frame and thread are focused in the Debug view via a new API. `vscode.debug.activeStackItem` retrieves what stack item (thread or stack frame) is currently focused, and `vscode.debug.onDidChangeActiveStackItem` is an event that fires when that changes.

This is useful in conjunction with APIs that extend VS Code's debug capabilities, such as ones that use the `DebugAdapterTracker`.

### `TestRunRequest.preserveFocus` API

Previously, test runs triggered by extensions would never move focus into the Test Results view like UI-initiated runs did. This is now configurable via a `preserveFocus` flag that can be set when creating a `TestRunRequest`. This flag defaults to `true` to maintain backwards compatibility.

## Proposed APIs

### Embeddings API

<!-- TODO@jrieken -->


### Attributable Test Coverage

We're working on an API that allows attributing test coverage on a per-test basis. This allows users to see which tests ran which code, filtering both the coverage shown in the editor and that in the **Test Coverage** view. Please see [vscode#212196](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/212196) for more information and updates.

### Hover Verbosity Level

Last iteration a new API has been proposed to provide hovers for which the verbosity can be increase or decreased. This iteration the API has been changed so that the `HoverVerbosityRequest` uses a `verbosityDelta` to signal the relative increase/decrease in the hover verbosity level. Previously the `HoverVerbosityRequest` used an enum `HoverVerbosityAction` to signal if the verbosity should be increased or decreased.

## Engineering

### Tracking memory efficiency on startup

We measure startup performance of VS Code insiders every day across Windows, macOS and Linux. Our main interest is how fast startup is until a text file is opened.

This month we added another metric that we plan to improve to make startup even faster: how much memory do we consume and how much of that memory ends up being garbage collected by V8. If we can bring that number down, startup time will be less affected by V8 garbage collection runs.

![Memory Efficiency](images/1_90/memory-perf.png)

### Electron 29 update

In this milestone, we are promoting the Electron 29 update to users on our stable release. This update comes with Chromium 122.0.6261.156 and Node.js 20.9.0. We want to thank everyone who self-hosted on Insiders builds and provided early feedback.

## Notable fixes

* [212386](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/212386) Local history: does not preserve entries from previously deleted file
* [213645](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/213645) Aux window does not work in Firefox
* vscode-js-debug#[2000](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/pull/2000)/[2002](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/pull/2002) the JavaScript debugger is faster, especially dealing with source map renames

## Thank you
