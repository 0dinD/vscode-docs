# May 2021 (version 1.57)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the May 1.57 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the May milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[May iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/123368)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22May+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Workbench

### Improved editor drag and drop across windows

Support for dragging editors to other windows was improved in this release. You can now drag diff editors, custom editors and the entire editor group to another window to open the editors there.

*Theme: [GitHub Light Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme)*

### Removed `Cmd+W` / `Ctrl+W` as keybinding to close window when no editor is opened

We have gotten [feedback](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/54492) that users are frustrated when the window suddenly closes after having closed the last editor via rapid `Cmd+W` / `Ctrl+W` usages. A quick poll in the team also revealed that many had the keybinding for closing a window unassigned, so we went ahead and removed `Cmd+W` / `Ctrl+W` as keybinding to close window when no editor is opened.

You can easily bring the keybinding back by configuring it as follows:

**macOS**
```json
{
  "key": "cmd+w",
  "command": "workbench.action.closeWindow",
  "when": "!editorIsOpen && !multipleEditorGroups"
}
```

**Windows/Linux**
```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+w",
  "command": "workbench.action.closeWindow",
  "when": "!editorIsOpen && !multipleEditorGroups"
}
```

**Note:** on all platforms there is a dedicated assigned keybinding to close the window:
* macOS: `Cmd+Shift+W`
* Linux: `Alt+F4`
* Windows: `Alt+F4`

## Extension authoring

### New status bar item `id` and `name` properties

We finalized the API for `StatusBarItem` identifier and name properties. The identifier can be passed from the new overload of the `createStatusBarItem` method while the `name` property can change dynamically on the `StatusBarItem` itself.

These new properties are used for the context menu on the status bar to give individual entries a name and for allowing a user to show and hide entries. If you do not provide these properties, the menu will aggregate all status entries from one extension under a single entry.

![Status bar item menu](images/1_57/status-menu.png)

If your extension contributes to the status bar, please consider updating to the new API.

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [vscode.proposed.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project's source location.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Enable file system providers to stat a file as readonly

File system providers can now mark individual files as readonly via a new `permissions` property on the `FileStat` by setting the value of the property to `FilePermission.Readonly`.

Readonly files are not editable.

**Note:** If all files should be treated readonly, you can use the existing `isReadonly` option when calling `registerFileSystemProvider`.

## Engineering

This milestone we continued to make the VS Code window ready for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation) features.

Specifically:

* We removed node.js dependencies from more code that is used in the renderer
* We continued investigating to drop `webview` usage entirely and switch to `iframe` for our custom views and editors

## Integrated Terminal

### Terminal tabs

Tabs are now enabled by default.

A tab's color can be changed to enable quick navigation and differentiation between them.

Tabs can be dragged and dropped to allow for re-arranging.

![drag and drop](images/1_57/tabs-drag-and-drop.gif)

Dragging a tab in a terminal group into the empty area will remove it from the group (ie. unsplit).

![unsplit](images/1_57/tabs-unsplit.gif)

Dragging a tab into the main terminal area allows joining a group.

![joining](images/1_57/tabs-joining.gif)

We've added more ways to split a terminal:
- on hover, select the inline split button
- right click the context menu and select the `Split...` submenu option
- `kbstyle(alt)` click a tab, the plus button, or the the single tab on the terminal panel as shown below

## Extension Contributions
### VS Code Live Server
We have begun development on our own Live Server extension, which can be used to preview webpages.
Our goal is to create an extension similar to the existing [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), but with support for new features such as
in-editor previewing and live reload.

For more details on the progress, see the [May 2021 Release Notes for the extension](https://github.com/andreamah/VS-Code-LiveServer-V2-Extension/blob/main/release_notes/v0_1.md)! You can also find the repository for it [here](https://github.com/andreamah/VS-Code-LiveServer-V2-Extension).

## Notable fixes

* [85332](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/85332): Windows: freeze on file delete
* [85332](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/108804): Do not wait for shell environment resolution before opening window
