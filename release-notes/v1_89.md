## Accessibility

### Terminal accessible view improvements

Now, when navigating to the next `(kb(workbench.action.terminal.accessibleBufferGoToNextCommand))` or previous `(kb(workbench.action.terminal.accessibleBufferGoToPreviousCommand))` command in the terminal accessible view, users will hear if the current command failed. This can be configured with the setting <code codesetting='accessibility.signals.terminalCommandFailed'>accessibility.signals.terminalCommandFailed</code>.

When this view is opened from a terminal with shell integration enabled, we alert with the terminal command line for an improved experience.

### Progress accessibility signal

The setting, <code codesetting='accessibility.signals.progress'>accessibility.signals.progress</code>, allows screen reader users to hear progress anywhere there is a progress bar. The signal will play after 3 seconds have elapsed and will loop every 5 seconds until completion. A signal may play when searching a workspace, while a chat response is pending, when a notebook cell is running, etc.

## Workbench

### Language models usage

You can now also track language models usage of the extension that contributed the language models in the Extension Editor and Runtime Extensions Editor. Following images show the number of requests made by the Copilot Chat Extension to the language models.

## Editor


## Source Control


## Terminal

### Git Bash shell integration enabled by default

Shell integration for Git Bash is now [automatically enabled](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_automatic-script-injection). This brings many features to Git Bash such as [command navigation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_command-navigation), [sticky scroll](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_sticky-scroll), [quick fixes](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_quick-fixes), etc.

### Configure middle click to paste

On most Linux distributions, middle click will paste the selection. Similar behavior can now be enabled on other operating systems by configuring `terminal.integrated.middleClickBehavior` to `paste` which will paste the regular clipboard content on middle click.

### Expanded ANSI hyperlink support

ANSI hyperlinks made via the [OSC 8 escape sequence](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda) previously supported only `http` and `https` protocols but now work with any protocol. By default only links with the  `file`, `http`, `https`, `mailto`, `vscode` and `vscode-insiders` protocols will activate for security reasons, but more can be added via the `terminal.integrated.allowedLinkSchemes` setting.

### New icon picker for the terminal

Selecting change icon from the terminal tab context menu will now open the new icon picker that was build for profiles:

![The new icon picker shows a preview and the id of the icon as well as a filter box](images/1_89/terminal-icon-picker.png)

_Theme: [Sapphire](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.theme-sapphire) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/Tyriar.theme-sapphire))_

### Support for window size reporting

The terminal will now respond to the following escape sequence requests:

- `CSI 14 t` to report the terminal's window size in pixels
- `CSI 16 t` to report the terminal's cell size in pixels
- `CSI 18 t` to report the terminal's window size in characters

### ⚠️ Deprecation of the canvas renderer

The terminal features 3 different renderers: the DOM renderer, the WebGL renderer and the canvas renderer. We have wanted to remove the canvas renderer for some time but was blocked by unacceptable performance in the DOM renderer and WebKit not implementing `webgl2`. Both of these issues have now been resolved!

This release we removed the canvas renderer from the fallback chain so it will only be enabled when the `terminal.integrated.gpuAcceleration` setting is explicitly set to `"canvas"`. We plan to remove the canvas renderer entirely in the next release. Please let us know if you have issues when `terminal.integrated.gpuAcceleration` is set to both `"on"` or `"off"`.

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO: add remote highlights here

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### Terminal Inline Chat

Terminal inline chat is now the default experience in the terminal. Use the `kb(inlinechat.start)` keybinding when the terminal is focused to bring it up.

![Opening terminal inline chat will open and focus an input box similar to inline chat in the editor](images/1_89/terminal-chat-1.png)

The terminal Inline Chat uses the `@terminal` chat participant, which has context about the integrated terminal's shell and its contents.

![You can ask complex questions like "list the top 5 largest files in the src dir"](images/1_89/terminal-chat-2.png)

Once a command is suggested, use `kb(workbench.action.terminal.chat.runCommand)` to run the command in the terminal or `kb(workbench.action.terminal.chat.insertCommand)` to insert the command into the terminal. The command can also be edited directly in Copilot's response before running it (currently `kbstyle(Ctrl+down)`, `kbstyle(Tab)`, `kbstyle(Tab)` on Windows & Linux, `kbstyle(Cmd+down)`, `kbstyle(Tab)`, `kbstyle(Tab)` on macOS).

![Complex queries are OS and shell-specific](images/1_89/terminal-chat-3.png)

## API

### Comment input text documents

<!-- TODO @mjbvz -->


## Proposed APIs

### Accessibility Help Dialog for a view

An accessibility help dialog can be added for any extension contributed view via the `accessibilityHelpContent` property. With focus in the view, screen reader users hear a hint to open the can open the dialog `(kb(editor.action.accessibilityHelp))`, which contains an overview and helpful commands that can be taken.

This has been adopted for the Github Pull Request extension's Issues and PR views.

### Language model and Chat API

The language model namespace (`vscode.lm`) exports new functions to retrieve language model information and to count tokens for a given strings. Those are `getLanguageModelInformation` and `computeTokenLength` respectively. You should use these functions to build prompts that are within the limits of a language model.

Note that inline chat is now powered by the upcoming chat particpants API. This also means `registerInteractiveEditorSessionProvider` is deprecated and will be removed very soon.

### Updates paste proposal

<!-- TODO @mjbvz -->

### Hover Verbosity Level

This iteration we have added a new proposed API to contract/expand hovers. The API is called `editorHoverVerbosityLevel`. It introduces a new type called the `VerboseHover` which has two boolean fields `canIncreaseHoverVerbosity` and `canDecreaseHoverVerbosity` which signal that a hover verbosity can be increased or decreased. If one of them is set to true, the hover is displayed with `+` and `-` icons which can be used to increase/decrease the hover verbosity. The proposed API also introduces a new signature for the `provideHover` method which takes an additional parameter of type `HoverContext`. When a hover verbosity request is sent by the user, the hover context is populated with the previous hover as well as a `HoverVerbosityAction` which indicates whether the user would like to increase or decrease the verbosity.
