## Accessibility


## Workbench

### Language models usage

You can now also track language models usage of the extension that contributed the language models in the Extension Editor and Runtime Extensions Editor. Following images show the number of requests made by the Copilot Chat Extension to the language models.

## Editor


## Source Control


## Terminal

### Git Bash shell integration enabled by default

Shell integration for Git Bash is now [automatically enabled](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_automatic-script-injection). This brings many features to Git Bash such as [command navigation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_command-navigation), [sticky scroll](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_sticky-scroll), [quick fixes](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_quick-fixes), etc.

### Configure middle click to paste

On most Linux distributions, middle click will paste the selection. Similar behavior can now be enabled on other operating systems by configuring `terminal.integrated.middleClickBehavior` to `paste` which will paste the regular clipboard content on middle click.

### Expanded ANSI hyperlink support

ANSI hyperlinks made via the [OSC 8 escape sequence](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda) previously supported only `http` and `https` protocols but now work with any protocol. By default only links with the  `file`, `http`, `https`, `mailto`, `vscode` and `vscode-insiders` protocols will activate for security reasons, but more can be added via the `terminal.integrated.allowedLinkSchemes` setting.

### New icon picker for the terminal

Selecting change icon from the terminal tab context menu will now open the new icon picker that was build for profiles:

_Theme: [Sapphire](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.theme-sapphire) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/Tyriar.theme-sapphire))_

### Support for window size reporting

The terminal will now respond to the following escape sequence requests:

- `CSI 14 t` to report the terminal's window size in pixels
- `CSI 16 t` to report the terminal's cell size in pixels
- `CSI 18 t` to report the terminal's window size in characters

### ⚠️ Deprecation of the canvas renderer

The terminal features 3 different renderers: the DOM renderer, the WebGL renderer and the canvas renderer. We have wanted to remove the canvas renderer for some time but was blocked by unacceptable performance in the DOM renderer and WebKit not implementing `webgl2`. Both of these issues have now been resolved!

This release we removed the canvas renderer from the fallback chain so it will only be enabled when the `terminal.integrated.gpuAcceleration` setting is explicitly set to `"canvas"`. We plan to remove the canvas renderer entirely in the next release. Please let us know if you have issues when `terminal.integrated.gpuAcceleration` is set to both `"on"` or `"off"`.

### Hover Verbosity Level

This iteration we have added a new proposed API to contract/expand hovers. The API is called `editorHoverVerbosityLevel`. It introduces a new type called the `VerboseHover` which has two boolean fields `canIncreaseHoverVerbosity` and `canDecreaseHoverVerbosity` which signal that a hover verbosity can be increased or decreased. If one of them is set to true, the hover is displayed with `+` and `-` icons which can be used to increase/decrease the hover verbosity. The proposed API also introduces a new signature for the `provideHover` method which takes an additional parameter of type `HoverContext`. When a hover verbosity request is sent by the user, the hover context is populated with the previous hover as well as a `HoverVerbosityAction` which indicates whether the user would like to increase or decrease the verbosity.
