## Accessibility

### Progress accessibility signal

The setting, <code codesetting='accessibility.signals.progress'>accessibility.signals.progress</code>, allows screen reader users to hear progress anywhere there is a progress bar. The signal will play after 3 seconds have elapsed and will loop every 5 seconds until completion. A signal may play when searching a workspace, while a chat response is pending, when a notebook cell is running, etc.

### Accessible view

Screen reader users focus features around the workbench and inspect them more closely by opening the accessible view `(kb(editor.action.accessibleView))`.

#### Terminal improvements

Now, when navigating to the next `(kb(workbench.action.terminal.accessibleBufferGoToNextCommand))` or previous `(kb(workbench.action.terminal.accessibleBufferGoToPreviousCommand))` command in the terminal accessible view, users will hear if the current command failed. This can be configured with the setting <code codesetting='accessibility.signals.terminalCommandFailed'>accessibility.signals.terminalCommandFailed</code>.

When this view is opened from a terminal with shell integration enabled, we alert with the terminal command line for an improved experience.

#### Chat code block navigation

When in the accessible view for a chat response, users can navigate between next `(kb(editor.action.accessibleViewNextCodeBlock))` and previous `(kb(editor.action.accessibleViewPreviousCodeBlock))` code blocks.

#### Github Pull Request extension comments view

With a PR checked out, and the comments panel focused, a user can inspect and navigate between these in the accessible view. Actions like resolve, unresolve, reply, and more can be taken from within this view.

## Workbench

### Language models usage

You can now also track language models usage of the extension that contributed the language models in the Extension Editor and Runtime Extensions Editor. Following images show the number of requests made by the Copilot Chat Extension to the language models.

<!-- TODO @amunger -->

### Fix for outline/sticky scroll performance regressions

Over the past few months, we have received feedback about performance regressions in the notebook editor. The regressions are difficult to pinpoint and not easily reproducible. Thanks to the community for continuously providing logs and feedback that helped us identify the regressions coming from the outline and sticky scroll features as we added new features to them. The issues have been fixed in this release.

We appreciate the community's feedback and patience, and we will continue to improve Notebook Editor's performance. If you continue to experience performance issues, please don't hesitate to file a new issue in the [VS Code repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Terminal

## Search

### Quick Search
Quick Search is no longer experimental. Give it a try! ‚ú®üîç

<video src="images/1_89/quick-search.mp4" title="Quick Search demo" autoplay loop controls muted></video>
_Theme: [Night Owl Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/sdras.night-owl))_

Note that all Quick Search commands and settings no longer have the "experimental" keyword in its IDs. For example, the command ID `workbench.action.experimental.quickTextSearch` became `workbench.action.quickTextSearch`. This may be relevant if you have settings or keybindings that use old IDs.

### Search Tree Recursive Expansion
We have a new context menu option that allows you to recursively open a selected tree node in the search tree.

<video src="images/1_89/search-tree-recurse-open.mp4" title="Recursively open search tree nodes" autoplay loop controls muted></video>
_Theme: [Night Owl Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/sdras.night-owl))_

### Git Bash shell integration enabled by default

Shell integration for Git Bash is now [automatically enabled](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_automatic-script-injection). This brings many features to Git Bash such as [command navigation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_command-navigation), [sticky scroll](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_sticky-scroll), [quick fixes](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_quick-fixes), etc.

### Configure middle click to paste

On most Linux distributions, middle click will paste the selection. Similar behavior can now be enabled on other operating systems by configuring `terminal.integrated.middleClickBehavior` to `paste` which will paste the regular clipboard content on middle click.

### Expanded ANSI hyperlink support

ANSI hyperlinks made via the [OSC 8 escape sequence](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda) previously supported only `http` and `https` protocols but now work with any protocol. By default only links with the  `file`, `http`, `https`, `mailto`, `vscode` and `vscode-insiders` protocols will activate for security reasons, but more can be added via the `terminal.integrated.allowedLinkSchemes` setting.

### New icon picker for the terminal

Selecting change icon from the terminal tab context menu will now open the new icon picker that was build for profiles:

![The new icon picker shows a preview and the id of the icon as well as a filter box](images/1_89/terminal-icon-picker.png)

_Theme: [Sapphire](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.theme-sapphire) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/Tyriar.theme-sapphire))_

### Support for window size reporting

The terminal will now respond to the following escape sequence requests:

- `CSI 14 t` to report the terminal's window size in pixels
- `CSI 16 t` to report the terminal's cell size in pixels
- `CSI 18 t` to report the terminal's window size in characters

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecation of the canvas renderer

The terminal features 3 different renderers: the DOM renderer, the WebGL renderer and the canvas renderer. We have wanted to remove the canvas renderer for some time but was blocked by unacceptable performance in the DOM renderer and WebKit not implementing `webgl2`. Both of these issues have now been resolved!

This release we removed the canvas renderer from the fallback chain so it will only be enabled when the `terminal.integrated.gpuAcceleration` setting is explicitly set to `"canvas"`. We plan to remove the canvas renderer entirely in the next release. Please let us know if you have issues when `terminal.integrated.gpuAcceleration` is set to both `"on"` or `"off"`.

## Tasks


## Debug


## Testing


## Languages

### Image previews in Markdown path completions

VS Code's built-in Markdown tooling provides path completions for links and images in your Markdown. When completing a path to an image or video file, we now show a small preview directly in the [completion details](../docs/editor/intellisense.md#intellisense-features):

![A preview of an image in Markdown path completions](images/1_89/md-path-completion-preview.png)

This can help you find the image or video you're after.

### Hover to preview images and videos in Markdown

Want a quick preview of an image or video in some Markdown without opening the full [Markdown preview](../docs/languages/markdown.md#markdown-preview)? Now you can hover over image or video's path to see a small preview of it:

![Hovering over an image's path to preview it](images/1_89/md-hover-preview.png)

### Improvements to Markdown renaming when headers are duplicated

Did you know that VS Code's built-in Markdown support lets you rename headers using `kbstyle(F2)`? This is useful because it also [automatically updates all links to header](../docs/languages/markdown.md#rename-headers-and-links). This iteration, we improved handling of renaming in cases where a Markdown file has duplicated headers.

Consider the Markdown file:

```md
# Readme
- [Example 1](#example)
- [Example 2](#example-1)

## Example
...

## Example
...
```

The two `## Example` headers have the same text but can each be linked to individually using a unique id (`#example` and `#example-1`). Previously if you renamed the first `## Example` header to `## First Example`, the `#example` link would be correctly changed to `#first-example` but the `#example-1` link would not be changed. However `#example-1` is no longer a valid link since after the rename there are no longer duplicated `## Example` headers.

We not corretly handle this. If you rename the first `## Example` header to `## First Example` in the document above for instance, the new document will be:

```md
# Readme
- [Example 1](#first-example)
- [Example 2](#example)

## First Example
...

## Example
...
```

Notice how both links have now been automatically updated so that they both remain valid!

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO: add remote highlights here

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_89.md).

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### Terminal Inline Chat

Terminal inline chat is now the default experience in the terminal. Use the `kb(inlinechat.start)` keybinding when the terminal is focused to bring it up.

![Opening terminal inline chat will open and focus an input box similar to inline chat in the editor](images/1_89/terminal-chat-1.png)

The terminal Inline Chat uses the `@terminal` chat participant, which has context about the integrated terminal's shell and its contents.

![You can ask complex questions like "list the top 5 largest files in the src dir"](images/1_89/terminal-chat-2.png)

Once a command is suggested, use `kb(workbench.action.terminal.chat.runCommand)` to run the command in the terminal or `kb(workbench.action.terminal.chat.insertCommand)` to insert the command into the terminal. The command can also be edited directly in Copilot's response before running it (currently `kbstyle(Ctrl+down)`, `kbstyle(Tab)`, `kbstyle(Tab)` on Windows & Linux, `kbstyle(Cmd+down)`, `kbstyle(Tab)`, `kbstyle(Tab)` on macOS).

![Complex queries are OS and shell-specific](images/1_89/terminal-chat-3.png)

#### Preview: Ask questions using Bing search and enterprise knowledge bases

[GitHub Copilot Enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/github-copilot-enterprise/overview/about-github-copilot-enterprise) users in VS Code can now ask questions that are enriched with context from web results and your enterprise's [knowledge bases](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/github-copilot-enterprise/copilot-chat-in-github/managing-copilot-knowledge-bases).

To try out this functionality, install the latest pre-release of Copilot Chat. In panel chat, you can then ask questions like `@github What is the latest LTS of Node.js? #web` to take advantage of web search. Any search results referenced by Copilot will be displayed in the `Used References` section of the chat response.

![Web search results in Copilot Chat](images/1_89/copilot-enterprise-bing-kbs.png)

You can also ask questions about your enterprise's knowledge bases, which are collections of Markdown repositories containing documentation, directly from VS Code. Simply type `@github #kb` to pick from the knowledge bases available to you. Similarly, any knowledge base snippets referenced by Copilot will be displayed in the `Used References` section of the chat response.

This allows Copilot Enterprise users to combine search results and internal documentation with editor context using existing chat variables like `#file` and `#selection`. Please try it out and share your feedback with us at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release!

#### Preview: Generate in Notebook Editor

We now support inserting new cell with inline chat activated automatically in the notebook editor. We will show a "Generate" button on the notebook toolbar and the insert toolbar between cells when the setting <code codesetting="notebook.experimental.generate">notebook.experimental.generate</code> is set to `true`. It can also be triggered by pressing `kbstyle(Cmd+I)` on macOS (or `kbstyle(Ctrl+I)` on Windows/Linux) when the focus is on the notebook list or cell container. This feature can help simplify the process of generating code in new cells with the help of the language model.

### Python

#### "Implement all inherited abstract classes" code action
Working with abstract classes is now easier when using Pylance. When defining a new class that inherits from an abstract one, you can now use the "Implement all inherited abstract classes" code action to automatically implement all abstract methods and properties from the parent class:

<video src="images/1_89/pylance-implement-abstract-classes.mp4" title="Implement all inherited abstract classes code action from Pylance." autoplay loop controls muted></video>
_Theme: [Catppuccin Macchiato](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Catppuccin.catppuccin-vsc) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/Catppuccin.catppuccin-vsc/Catppuccin%20Macchiato))_

#### New auto indentation setting
Previously, Pylance's auto indentation behaviour was controlled through the <code codesetting='editor.formatOnType'>editor.formatOnType</code> setting, which used to be problematic if one would want to disable auto indentation but enable  format on type with other supported tools. To solve this problem, Pylance has its own setting to control its auto indentation behaviour, <code codesetting='python.analysis.autoIndent'>python.analysis.autoIndent</code>, which is enabled by default.

![Python Analysis Auto Indent setting to control auto indentation with Pylance](images/1_89/pylance-auto-indent-setting.png)


#### Debugpy removed from the Python extension in favor of the Python Debugger extension

Now that debugging functionality is handled by the [Python Debugger](
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy)
extension, we have removed the copy of debugpy from the Python extension. As part of this change, `"type": "python"` and `"type": "debugpy"` specified in your `launch.json` file will both reference the path to the Python Debugger extension, requiring no changes needed to your `launch.json` files in order to run and debug effectively. Moving forward, we recommend using `"type": "debugpy"` as this directly corresponds to the Python Debugger extension.

#### Socket disablement now possible during testing

You can now run tests with socket disablement from the testing UI on the Python Testing Rewrite. This is made possible by a switch in the communication between the Python extension and the test run subprocess to now use named-pipes.

#### Minor Testing Bugs Updated
Test view now displays projects using testscenarios with unittest and parameterized tests inside nested classes correctly. Additionally the test explorer now handles tests in workspaces with symlinks, specifically workspace roots which are children of symlink-ed paths which is particularly helpful in WSL scenarios.

#### Performance improvements with Pylance
The Pylance team has been receiving feedback that Pylance's performance has degraded in the past few releases. We have made several smaller improvements in memory consumption and indexing peformance to address various reported issues. However, for those who may still be experiencing performance issues with Pylance, we are kindly requesting for issues to be filed through the **Pylance: Report Issue** command from the Command Palette, ideally with logs, code samples and/or the packages that are installed in the working environment.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

#### Paste to create Markdown links in comment editors

### TypeScript

##### File watching handled by VS Code core

A new experimental setting `typescript.tsserver.experimental.useVsCodeWatcher` controls if the TS extension is using VS Code's core file watching support for file watching needs. TS makes extensive use of file watching, usually with their own node.js based implementation. By using VS Code's file watcher, watching should be more efficient, more reliable and consume less resources. We plan to gradually enable this feature for users in May and monitor for regressions.

<!-- TODO @alexr00 -->

## Preview Features

### VS Code-native intellisense for PowerShell

We've had a prototype for PowerShell intellisense inside the terminal for some time now that we only recently got some more time to invest in polishing up. This is what it looks like:

<video src="images/1_89/terminal-intellisense.mp4" title="VS Code-native PowerShell intellisense" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

Currently it will trigger on the `-` character or when ctrl+space is pressed. To enable this feature, set `"terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.suggestEnabled": true` in your settings.json file (it won't show up in the settings UI currently).

It's still early for this feature but we'd love to hear your feedback on it. Some of the bigger things we have planned for it are to make triggering it more reliable ([#211222](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/211222)), make the suggestions more consistent regardless of where the popup is triggered ([#211364](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/211364)) and bringing the experience as close to the editor intellisense UX as possible ([#211076](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/211076), [#211194](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/211194))

### Automatic Markdown link updates on paste

Say you're writing some Markdown documentation and you realize that one section of the doc actually belongs somewhere else. So you copy and paste it over into another file. All good, right? Well if the copied text contained any relative path links, reference links, or images, these will likely now be broken and you'll have to fix them up manually. This can be a real pain but thankfully the new Update Links on Paste is here to help!

To enable this, just set `"markdown.experimental.updateLinksOnPaste": true`. Once enabled, when you copy and paste text between Markdown files in the current editor, VS Code will automatically fix all relative oath links, reference links, and all images/videos with relative paths.

<!-- TODO @mjbvz video -->

After pasting, if you realize that you instead want to insert the exact text you copied, you can use the paste widget to switch back to normal copy/paste behavior.


### Support for TypeScript 5.5

We now support the TypeScript 5.5 beta. Check out the [TypeScript 5.5 beta blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-5-beta/) and [iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/57475) for details on this release. Editor highlights include:

* Syntax checks for regular expressions.
* File watching improvements.

To start using the TypeScript 5.5 beta, just install the [TypeScript Nightly extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next). Please share feedback and let us know if you run into any bugs with TypeScript 5.5.


## API

### Improved support for language features in comment input editors

When writing a new comment, VS Code creates a stripped down text editor which is backed by a `TextDocument`, just like the main editors in VS Code are. This iteration, we've enabled some additional API features in these comment text editors. This includes:

- Support for workspace edits.
- Support for diagnostics.
- Support for the paste-as proposed API.

Comment text documents can be identified by a uri with the scheme: `comment`.

We're looking forward to see what extensions build with this new functionality!


## Proposed APIs

### Accessibility Help Dialog for a view

An accessibility help dialog can be added for any extension contributed view via the `accessibilityHelpContent` property. With focus in the view, screen reader users hear a hint to open the can open the dialog `(kb(editor.action.accessibilityHelp))`, which contains an overview and helpful commands that can be taken.

This has been adopted for the Github Pull Request extension's Issues and PR views.

### Language model and Chat API

The language model namespace (`vscode.lm`) exports new functions to retrieve language model information and to count tokens for a given strings. Those are `getLanguageModelInformation` and `computeTokenLength` respectively. You should use these functions to build prompts that are within the limits of a language model.

Note that inline chat is now powered by the upcoming chat particpants API. This also means `registerInteractiveEditorSessionProvider` is deprecated and will be removed very soon.

### Updated document paste proposal

We've continued iterating on the [document paste proposed api](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.documentPaste.d.ts). This API allows extensions to hook into copy/paste operations in text documents.

Notable changes to the API include:

- A new `resolveDocumentPasteEdit` method which fills in the edit on a paste operation. This should be used if computing the edit takes a long time as it will only be called when the paste edit actually needs to be applied.

- All paste operations now are identified by a `DocumentDropOrPasteEditKind`. This works much like the existing `CodeActionKind` and will be used in keybindings and settings for paste operations.

The [document paste extension sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/document-paste) includes all the latest API changes so you can test out the API. Be sure to share feedback on the changes and overall API design.

### Hover Verbosity Level

This iteration we have added a new proposed API to contract/expand hovers. The API is called `editorHoverVerbosityLevel`. It introduces a new type called the `VerboseHover` which has two boolean fields `canIncreaseHoverVerbosity` and `canDecreaseHoverVerbosity` which signal that a hover verbosity can be increased or decreased. If one of them is set to true, the hover is displayed with `+` and `-` icons which can be used to increase/decrease the hover verbosity. The proposed API also introduces a new signature for the `provideHover` method which takes an additional parameter of type `HoverContext`. When a hover verbosity request is sent by the user, the hover context is populated with the previous hover as well as a `HoverVerbosityAction` which indicates whether the user would like to increase or decrease the verbosity.
