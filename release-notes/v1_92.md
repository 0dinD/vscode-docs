Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the July 1.92 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the July milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22July+2024%22)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Workbench

### Panel Top
The workbench panel can now be moved to the top of the workbench, above the editor grid. By default, this panel is placed at the bottom and includes views such as the Terminal, Output, and Debug Console. This enhancement complements the existing options of positioning the panel to the left, right, and bottom.

### Profiles Editor preview

In this milestone, we continued to improve the Profiles Editor by making it more user-friendly and have consistent look and feel with Settings Editor.

The Profiles Editor is available as an experimental feature behind the <code codesetting="workbench.experimental.enableNewProfilesUI">workbench.experimental.enableNewProfilesUI</code> setting. Once enabled, you can access the Profiles Editor from the Settings gear icon in the bottom left corner of the window.

### Override existing Profile

You can now override the existing profile including the default profile while creating a new profile. This allows you to create a new profile with the same name as an existing profile and override its contents.

### Improved extension update experience

In this milestone, we have made several improvements to the extension update experience. These give you more control over updating extensions and make it easier to manage auto updating of extensions.

**Manage Auto Updating All Extensions**

We have changed the global extension auto update action in the Extension view title area in to **Enable Auto Update for All Extensions** and **Disable Auto Update for All Extensions** actions. These actions allow you to enable or disable auto update for all extensions at once.

**Manage Auto Updating Individual Extensions**

We have improved the individual extension auto update experience by showing the action to enable or disable auto update always. This makes it easier to manage auto updating of extensions.

**Disable Auto Update for Extensions Installed via VSIX**

When installing an extension via VSIX, auto update for that extension is disabled by default. This allows you to work with the version of the extension you have installed without it being updated automatically.

**Additional control over updating extensions**

User consent is now required to update current installed extension version with no code to a version with code. This gives you control to review such updates before they are applied. Following video shows the experience when updating an extension with no code to a version with code.

Clicking on the **Review** button will open the extension changelog or the extension repository in the browser. You can review the changes and then decide to update the extension.

## Debug

### Show variables types while debugging

VS Code will now show the data types of variables while debugging when the setting `"debug.showVariableTypes": true` is turned on:

## Proposed APIs

### Testing Enhancements

#### Call Stacks in Test Failure

We're working on an API that allows an extension to associated code to tests and vise versa. This lets users jump between the two and enables actions such as "Run Tests at Cursor" to also work in implementation code. We anticipate building more experiences as the API develops.

Check out [vscode#126932](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/126932#issuecomment-2243510427) for more information and updates.

#### Call Stacks in Test Failure

We're working on an API that enables associating a rich callstack with unit test failures. This allows users to see, at a glance, what code led up to their failure.

Check out [vscode#214488](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/214488) for more information and updates.

#### Attributable test coverage

We're working on an API that enables attributing test coverage on a per-test basis. This enables users to see which tests ran which code, filtering both the coverage shown in the editor, and that in the **Test Coverage** view.

Check out [vscode#212196](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/212196) for more information and updates.
