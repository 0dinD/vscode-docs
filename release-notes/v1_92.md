## Accessibility

### Improved debugging experience

#### Accessibility Help Dialogs

We added accessibility help dialogs for the Run and Debug view and Debug Console. You get a hint about opening the accessible help dialog when either view is focused. Configure this hint via the setting <a href="vscode://settings/accessibility.verbosity.debug" codesetting="true">`accessibility.verbosity.debug`</a>.

#### Debug Console Accessible View

Run the command **Open Accessible View** (`kb(editor.action.accessibleView)`) to inspect Debug Console content character by character, line by line.

The setting <a href="vscode://settings/debug.autoExpandLazyVariables" codesetting="true">`debug.autoExpandLazyVariables`</a> is now enabled when in `Screen Reader Optimized Mode`, for ready access to variable values.

When an expression is evaluated in the Debug Console, its value is now announced to screen reader users.

#### Dynamic watch variable announcement

When debugging with a screen reader enabled, you now hear when watch variable values change. Configure this with <a href="vscode://settings/accessibility.debugWatchVariableAnnouncements" codesetting="true">`accessibility.debugWatchVariableAnnouncements`</a>.

### Configure Keybindings action

In the previous milestone, we introduced an action to configure unassigned keybindings in the accessibility help dialog. We've now added the **Configure Assigned Keybindings** command (`kb(editor.action.accessibilityHelpConfigureAssignedKeybindings)`) to complement this action.

## Workbench

### Move panel to top

You can now move the [Panel](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) to the top of the workbench, above the editor area. By default, the Panel is placed at the bottom and includes views, such as the terminal, Output panel, and Debug Console. This enhancement complements the existing options of positioning the panel to the left, right, and bottom.

<video src="images/1_92/panel-top.mp4" title="Move Workbench Panel to the top" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Profiles Editor preview

In this milestone, we continued to improve the Profiles Editor by making it more user-friendly and by having a look and feel that's consistent with the Settings Editor.

![Profiles Editor showing all user profiles and their settings.](images/1_92/profiles-editor.png)

The Profiles Editor is available as an experimental feature behind the <a href="vscode://settings/workbench.experimental.enableNewProfilesUI" codesetting="true">`workbench.experimental.enableNewProfilesUI`</a> setting. Once enabled, you can access the Profiles Editor from the Settings gear icon in the bottom left corner of the window.

![Settings menu showing the Profiles menu item to open the Profiles Editor.](images/1_92/profiles-editor-action.png)

### Override existing profile

You can now override an existing profile, including the default profile, by creating a new profile with the same name.

<video src="images/1_92/override-profile.mp4" title="Override existing Profile" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

### Improved extension update experience

We made several improvements to the extension update experience to give you more control over updating extensions and make it easier to manage auto updating of extensions.

#### Auto updating all extensions

We have changed the global extension auto update action in the Extension view title area to **Enable Auto Update for All Extensions** and **Disable Auto Update for All Extensions** actions. With these actions, you can enable or disable auto update for all extensions at once.

![Manage Auto Updating Extensions.](images/1_92/manage-autoupdate.png)

#### Auto updating individual extensions

We improved the individual extension auto update experience by always showing the action to enable or disable auto update for the extension. This makes it easier to manage auto updating of extensions.

![Auto update configuration per extension.](images/1_92/extension-autoupdate.png)

#### Disable auto update for extensions installed via VSIX

When you install an extension via VSIX, auto update for that extension is disabled by default. This enables you to work with the version of the extension you have installed, without it being updated automatically.

#### More control over updating extensions

User consent is now required when you update an installed extension version that has no executable code to a version that has executable code. This gives you control to review such updates before they are applied. The following video demonstrates the experience when updating an extension with no code to a version with code.

<video src="images/1_92/auto-update-review.mp4" title="User consent required to update extension with no code to a version with code" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

Selecting the **Review** button opens the extension change log or the extension repository in the browser. You can review the changes and then decide if you want to update the extension.

### Settings Editor jump issue fixed

The Settings Editor used to jump after modifying a setting and changed focus to another one. And this jump was worse the more one scrolled before modifying a setting.
We changed the way the Settings Editor re-renders settings after modification, and the Settings Editor no longer jumps after modifying a setting.

<video src="images/1_92/settings-editor-nojitter.mp4" title="Settings Editor not jumping after setting check mark checked" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

_Theme: [Light Pink](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgwg.light-pink-theme) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/mgwg.light-pink-theme))_

### Configure the browser to open links

A new setting <a href="vscode://settings/workbench.externalBrowser" codesetting="true">`workbench.externalBrowser`</a> enables you to configure which browser to use for opening links. By default, the operating system standard browser is used. You can configure this setting on a per-workspace level and is Settings Sync enabled. To ensure correct functioning across devices, you can use browser aliases, such as `edge`, `chrome`, or `firefox`. Alternatively, you can also specify the full path to the browser executable as the settings value.

## Editor

### Using cursor as anchor when editor height changes

Before this change, the editor would try to keep the topmost visible line at the same position when objects, such as code-lenses, get added to the editor.

Now, when the cursor is in the view port, the editor tries to keep the line of the cursor stable. This reduces jumping in various cases, for example when using "go to definition".

### Lightbulb Widget Improvements

This iteration, we introduced an improved heuristic for the Lightbulb Widget (<a href="vscode://settings/editor.lightbulb.enabled" codesetting="true">`editor.lightbulb.enabled`</a>) which will spawn the widget in the gutter when there is no space, instead of blocking code in the editor. 


## Diff Editor

### True inline diffs

This iteration, we introduced the <a href="vscode://settings/diffEditor.experimental.useTrueInlineView" codesetting="true">`diffEditor.experimental.useTrueInlineView`</a> setting (off by default). When you enable this setting and the inline view is used, single-line changes are rendered inline:

![True Inline View](images/1_92/diffEditor_trueInlineView.png)

This feature is experimental and future changes are to be expected.

This is how the inline view looks without this experimental flag turned on:

![Default Inline View](images/1_92/diffEditor_defaultInlineView.png)

### More compact diffs in Inline Chat

We iterated on the diff editor layout in the Chat view/inline Chat and made it more compact.

Before:

![Before](images/1_92/diffEditor_inlineChat_before.png)

After:

![After](images/1_92/diffEditor_inlineChat_after.png)

## Source Control

## Notebooks

### Multi-cell commenting

The Notebook Editor now supports toggling comments on one or multiple cells at a time. Do this by selecting one or multiple cell containers, followed by the keyboard shortcut `kb(notebook.commentSelectedCells)`.

<video src="images/1_92/notebook-multi-cell-comment.mp4" title="Notebook Multi Cell Commenting" autoplay loop controls muted></video>

## Terminal


## Tasks


## Debug

### Show variable types while debugging

VS Code now shows the data types of variables while debugging when the setting <a href="vscode://settings/debug.showVariableTypes" codesetting="true">`debug.showVariableTypes`</a> is turned on:

![Show variable data types in the Variables section while debugging.](./images/1_92/debug-types.png)


## Testing


## Languages


## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO: add remote highlights here

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_92.md).

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

### `/runCommand` enabled by default

A new slash command, `/runCommand`, enables you to search for and execute a core VS Code command. It can be configured with <a href="vscode://settings/github.copilot.chat.runCommand.enabled" codesetting="true">`github.copilot.chat.runCommand.enabled`</a>.

### Code referencing in chat

You can allow GitHub Copilot to return code that may match publicly available code on GitHub.com. When this is enabled for your [organization](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/setting-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization#policies-for-suggestion-matching) or [personal settings](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/managing-copilot-policies-as-an-individual-subscriber#enabling-or-disabling-suggestions-matching-public-code), then currently, Copilot completions can provide you with details about the matches that were detected. We are working on enabling showing you these matches for code in Copilot Chat as well.

We are still working on testing this feature and rolling it out gradually for Copilot Chat users. Once it's enabled for your machine, you'll see a message at the end of the response with a "View matches" link. If you click the link, an editor will open showing you the details of the matching code. Here's an example:

![Chat code referencing example](images/1_92/code-references.png)

Read more about [code referencing in the GitHub Copilot docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/finding-public-code-that-matches-github-copilot-suggestions).


### Python

#### Improved Python discovery using python-environment-tools

In the [last release, we announced python environment tools](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/release-notes/v1_91.md#python-environment-discovery-using-python-environment-tools), which redesigned the Python discovery infrastructure focused on performance. This approach reduces the need for executing python binaries to probe for information and thus improving performance.

Starting in this release, we are rolling out this enhancement as part of an experiment. If you are interested in trying this out, you can set `"python.locator"` to `"native"` in your User `settings.json` and reload your VS Code window. Visit the [python-environment-tools repo](https://github.com/microsoft/python-environment-tools) to learn more about this feature, ongoing work, and provide feedback.

#### Correct execution status for native REPL and cleaner output

The experimental native REPL (`"python.REPL.sendToNativeREPL": true`) now displays success/failure UI, similar to that in a Jupyter cell, depending on the execution outcome. Furthermore, we made improvements so that we no longer display an empty line on cells that generate no output.

#### Inline Variable Values in source code

The Python Debugger extension introduced an Inline Values feature to enhance your Python debugging experience. This feature enables the display of variable values directly in the editor, next to the corresponding line of code during a debugging session. This helps you to quickly understand the state of your program without needing to hover over variables or check the variables pane. To enable this feature, set the configuration value  <a href="vscode://settings/debugpy.showPythonInlineValues" codesetting="true">`debugpy.showPythonInlineValues`</a> to `true` in your User settings.

> **Note**: This feature is currently in exploration state and improvements are still being made. Please provide any feedback you may have in the [vscode-python-debugger repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python-debugger)!

![Show Python Inline Variables.](images/1_92/show-python-inline-variables.png)

#### Improved Debug Welcome view

The Debug Welcome view now includes a button for quick access to automatic Python configurations when a Python file is open in the editor.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues


## Extension authoring

### Basic authentication for network proxies

Extensions that use the `https` Node.js module can now use network proxies that require basic authentication.

## Preview Features


## Proposed APIs

### `QuickInputButtonLocation` to show buttons to the right of the input

This milestone, we introduced a proposed API on `QuickInputButton` that enables extensions to choose where they want a button to be rendered. The options are:

* `Title`: This renders the button in the title bar of the quick pick. This is the default behavior and maintains the existing behavior of buttons.
* `Inline`: This renders the button to the right of the input box. This is useful if you aren't planning on using the title bar for anything but want to show buttons.

This functionality was adopted in the Git extension's **Create branch** input box, which you can enable with <a href="vscode://settings/git.branchRandomName.dictionary" codesetting="true">`git.branchRandomName.dictionary`</a>.

Check out [vscode#221397](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/221397) for more information and updates.

### Testing Enhancements

#### Associate code to tests

We're working on an API that enables an extension to associate code to tests, and vice versa. This lets users jump between both, and enables actions, such as "Run Tests at Cursor", to also work in implementation code. We anticipate building more experiences as the API develops.

Check out [vscode#126932](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/126932#issuecomment-2243510427) for more information and updates.

#### Call stacks in test failures

We're working on an API that enables associating a rich call stack with unit test failures. This enables users to see, at a glance, what code led up to their failure.

Check out [vscode#214488](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/214488) for more information and updates.

#### Attributable test coverage

We're working on an API that enables attributing test coverage on a per-test basis. This enables users to see which tests ran which code, filtering both the coverage shown in the editor, and that in the **Test Coverage** view.

Check out [vscode#212196](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/212196) for more information and updates.

### Search APIs

In the last few months, we have been working on finalizing three proposed Search APIs:

* [`FindTextInFiles`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/59924): find text in workspace files using VS Code's text search.
* [`FileSearchProvider`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/73524): provide file search results for custom file schemes that cannot be searched properly with VS Code's existing search functionality. For example, extension-provided results could show up when searching in Quick Open from within a virtual file system.
* [`TextSearchProvider`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/59921): like `FileSearchProvider`, but for text search results. For example, extension-provided results could show up when searching in the Search View from within a virtual file system.

In addition, we are revamping the [`workspace.findFiles`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/48674) API, which uses VS Code's workspace file search to find files. The new version should allow for more options, and should handle exclusion options more clearly. The existing function signature should still be functional when we introduce the revamped version.

This table illustrates how the different APIs are related:

|                     | Using API to find | Using API to provide results |
| --------:           | :-------:         | :-------:                    |
|**For Files**        | FindFiles         | FileSearchProvider           |
|**For Text in Files**| FindTextInFiles   | TextSearchProvider           |

## Engineering

### Website

We refreshed the design of the [VS Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and added support for light and dark themes.

![VS Code website light mode](/release-notes/images/1_92/landing-page-light.png)

The website's new design defaults to your system's theme (light or dark mode), and you can also toggle it manually by using the sun/moon icon in the top right.

![VS Code website dark mode](/release-notes/images/1_92/landing-page-dark.png)

We look forward to getting your feedback! File any feature requests or bugs in the [vscode-docs repo](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/issues).

### Progress on using ESM for VS Code

In this milestone we picked up the work again to adopt ESM for VS Code core. Our goal in the future is to use ECMAScript Modules (ESM) loading and drop AMD entirely. This will be a multi-milestone effort that will modernise code loading and bundling overall.

## Notable fixes

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
