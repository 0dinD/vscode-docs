Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the July 1.92 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the July milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A%22July+2024%22)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Workbench

### Panel Top
The workbench panel can now be moved to the top of the workbench, above the editor grid. By default, this panel is placed at the bottom and includes views such as the Terminal, Output, and Debug Console. This enhancement complements the existing options of positioning the panel to the left, right, and bottom.

### Profiles Editor preview

In this milestone, we continued to improve the Profiles Editor by making it more user-friendly and have consistent look and feel with Settings Editor.

The Profiles Editor is available as an experimental feature behind the <code codesetting="workbench.experimental.enableNewProfilesUI">workbench.experimental.enableNewProfilesUI</code> setting. Once enabled, you can access the Profiles Editor from the Settings gear icon in the bottom left corner of the window.

### Override existing Profile

You can now override the existing profile including the default profile while creating a new profile. This allows you to create a new profile with the same name as an existing profile and override its contents.

### Improved extension auto update experience

We have changed the global extension auto update action in the Extension view title area in to **Enable Auto Update for All Extensions** and **Disable Auto Update for All Extensions** actions. These actions allow you to enable or disable auto update for all extensions at once.

We have improved the individual extension auto update experience by showing the action to enable or disable auto update always. This makes it easier to manage auto updating of extensions.

![Auto update configuration per extension.](images/1_92/extension-autoupdate.png)

When installing an extension via VSIX, auto update for that extension is disabled by default. This allows you to work with the version of the extension you have installed without it being updated automatically.

Above improvements give you a better and consistent experience for managing auto update of extensions.

### Additional control over updating extensions

User consent is now required to update current installed extension version with no code to a version with code. This gives you control to review such updates before they are applied. Following video shows the experience when updating an extension with no code to a version with code.

Clicking on the **Review** button will open the extension changelog or the extension repository in the browser. You can review the changes and then decide to update the extension.
