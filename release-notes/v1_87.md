#### Inline Chat Accessibility View

Inline chat now has an accessibility view that shows code changes just like the accessible diff viewer does. It is enabled when using screen reader mode but can also be configured to be always on or off, use the <code codesetting="inlineChat.accessibleDiffView">inlineChat.accessibleDiffView</code>-setting for that.

Also, change-hunks can now be navigated with the keyboard via `kbstyle(F7)` and `kbstyle(Shift+F7)`.

#### Inline Chat Default Mode

We have retired the live preview mode and made `live` the default mode for inline chat.
