## Accessibility

### Voice: Editor Dictation

You can now use your voice to dictate directly into the text editor provided that you have installed the [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) extension.

<video src="images/1_87/editor-dictate.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Dictate to the editor using voice."></video>

New commands have been added to start and stop editor dictation (**Voice: Start Dictation in Editor** (`kb(workbench.action.editorDictation.start)`), **Voice: Stop Dictation in Editor** (`kb(workbench.action.editorDictation.stop)`)).

You can press and hold the keybinding for the start command (`kb(workbench.action.editorDictation.start)`) to enable walky-talky mode where the voice recognition will stop when you release the keys.

**Note:** this even works in other places where a rich editor is used, such as the SCM commit input box and the comments input field when reviewing Pull Requests.

### Voice: Languages Support

When you use the [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) extension, there is now a new setting <code codesetting="accessibility.voice.speechLanguage">accessibility.voice.speechLanguage</code> to select from one of 26 languages to recognize speech from.

<video src="images/1_87/voice-language.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Speech languages support via settings."></video>

Languages for the speech extension come as their own extension, so you will see an extension installation for each language you picked as soon as you start recording for the first time.

### Accessibility Signals

Accessibility signals encompass sounds, formerly called audio cues, and announcements,formerly called alerts.

The commands `Help: List Signal Sounds` and `Help: List Signal Announcements` allow users to view available signals and configure them. Migration to this new configuration happens automatically.

Before:

```
"audioCues.clear": "on | auto | off"
"accessibility.alert.clear": true | false
```

After:

```
"accessibility.signals.clear": {
    "sound": "auto | on | off",
    "announcement" (optional): "auto | off"
}
```

## Workbench


## Editor


## Source Control

### Repository/Branch name in the window title

Users can customize the window title using the <code codesetting="window.title">window.title</code> setting. This milestone we have added two new variables that can be used with this setting: `${activeRepositoryName}`, and `${activeRepositoryBranchName}`. When used, these variables will be replaced with the name of the active repository and the name of the active branch, respectively.

### Commit input validation improvements

This milestone we have explored using language diagnostics to provide better input validation when authoring commit messages. Using language diagnostics enables us to surface code actions that can be invoked to resolve the input validation warnings. We have added code actions to remove whitespace characters, hard wrap lines based on the <code codesetting="git.inputValidationSubjectLength">git.inputValidationSubjectLength</code>, and <code codesetting="git.inputValidationLength">git.inputValidationLength</code> settings, and we are looking to add more code actions in the future.

To enable it, toggle the <code codesetting="git.inputValidation:true">git.inputValidation</code> setting. We have some issues to work through before we can enable this by default, but in the meantime please feel free to enable it and let us know your feedback.

### Incoming/Outgoing changes settings management

We continue to polish the "Incoming/Outgoing" section of the Source Control view. This milestone we have added a settings action to the "Incoming/Outgoing" separator that allows users to toggle the <code codesetting="scm.showIncomingChanges">scm.showIncomingChanges</code>, <code codesetting="scm.showOutgoingChanges">scm.showOutgoingChanges</code>, <code codesetting="scm.showChangesSummary">scm.showChangesSummary</code> settings more easily. The same actions are also available in the "Incoming & Outgoing" menu in the `...` menu of the Source Control view's title bar.

### Close All Unmodified Editors command

To help with editor management, this milestone we have added a new command to the command palette, **Close All Unmodified Editors**, that will close all editors that have unmodified files. The command will not close editors that have unsaved changes.

### GitHub Copilot

#### Inline Chat Accessibility View

Inline chat now has an accessibility view that shows code changes just like the accessible diff viewer does. It is enabled when using screen reader mode but can also be configured to be always on or off, use the <code codesetting="inlineChat.accessibleDiffView">inlineChat.accessibleDiffView</code>-setting for that.

Also, change-hunks can now be navigated with the keyboard via `kbstyle(F7)` and `kbstyle(Shift+F7)`.

#### Inline Chat Default Mode

We have retired the live preview mode and made `live` the default mode for inline chat.

#### Voice: Always Visible Microphone Icon

The microphone icon to start voice recognition for input to the chat fields is now always visible, even when [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) is not yet installed. Clicking the icon will ask to install the extension to enable speech-to-text capabilities.

If you are not interested in this feature or want to only use it via keyboard shortcuts, you can easily hide the action from the right click menu:

#### Voice: Support for Agents and Slash Commands

When using the [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) extension to fill the chat input field via voice, phrases such as "at workspace" or "slash fix" will now translate into respective agent and slash commands.

<video src="images/1_87/voice-agent.mp4" autoplay loop controls muted title="Agent and slash commands support in Voice."></video>

This works in the chat view as well as inline chat.

#### Voice: Walky-talky mode everywhere

When using the [VS Code Speech](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-speech) extension, the command **Voice: Start Voice Chat** (`kb(workbench.action.chat.startVoiceChat)`) now works everywhere and will bring up a voice chat depending on where your focus is (inline chat in the editor, panel chat otherwise).

Press and hold the keybinding to enable walky-talky mode: voice recognition will run until you release the keys and then submit automatically.

#### `Copilot: Explain This` based on cursor position

Previously, `Explain This` required that you selected the text to explain in your active editor. You can now also place your cursor on an identifier to get Copilot to see the identifier's definition. If the definition is in another file, this requires rich language support to be available.
