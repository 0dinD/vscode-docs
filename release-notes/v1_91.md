## Accessibility

### Editor Hover Accessibility View/Help

This iteration, we have added an accessibility view and an accessibility help for the editor hover. The accessibility view/help shows accessible information for the current focused hover part or for the full content hover if it is entirely focused.


## Workbench

### Search
We have a new setting that allows you to limit the number of threads that the ripgrep search engine uses. This applies regardless whether it is being used by the core product or via the extension API. You can set `search.ripgrep.maxThreads` to a non-zero value to do this. Please be cautious when using this setting, as fixing this to a specific value may slow down ripgrep.

### Adjust allowed encodings for guessing

A new setting `files.candidateGuessEncodings` allows to configure a set of encodings that should be considered when `files.autoGuessEncoding` is enabled in the order of configuration. This allows to limit the possible encodings that can be detected to a smaller set and give higher priority to some.

## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO: add remote highlights here

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_91.md).

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### Compact Inline Chat

Inline chat rendering is now more compact, making it easier to read and understand suggestions. We are also experimenting with a more narrative style of buttons that you can enable via <code codesetting="inlineChat.experimental.textButtons:true">inlineChat.experimental.textButtons<truecode>

### Python

#### Python Environment Discovery using python-environment-tools 
We are excited to introduce a new tool, [python-environment-tools](https://github.com/microsoft/python-environment-tools), designed to significantly enhance the speed of detecting global Python installations and Python virtual environments. This tool utilizes Rust to ensure a rapid and accurate discovery process. We are currently testing this new feature, running it in parallel to the existing support, to evaluate the new discovery performance in the Python extension. Consequently, you will see a new logging channel called `Python Locator` that shows the discovery times with this new tool. This enhancement is part of our ongoing efforts to optimize the performance and efficiency of Python support in VS Code. Visit the [python-environment-tools repo](https://github.com/microsoft/python-environment-tools) to learn more about this feature, ongoing work, and provide feedback. 

#### Smart Send in Native REPL

The Python extension has now enabled [Smart Send]( https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-november-2023-release/#improvements-to-shift-enter-run-line-in-terminal ) in the [VS Code native REPL]( https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-june-2024-release/#vs-code-native-repl-for-python-with-intellisense-and-syntax-highlighting ). Previously, when you placed your cursor on a line of Python code and pressed Shift+Enter, the Python extension would send the exact line contents to the native REPL, even if it would fail, for example, due to being part of a multi-line command. Shift+Enter will now send minimum executable code in a non-nested scenario, or the highest top-level block of code in a nested scenario. This allows users to quickly Shift+Enter throughout their file to run the maximum amount of executable code with the least amount of effort.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues


## Preview Features


## Proposed APIs

### Tools & Functions for Language Models

We have added an API proposal that enables tools- or functions-calling. It comes with two major pieces

1. Give extension that ability to register a "tool". A tool is a piece of functionality that is meant to be used by language models, e.g. reading the GIT history of a file.

2. The mechanics for language models to support tools, e.g extension passing tools when making a request, language models requesting a tool-invocation, and extensions communicating back the result of a tool-invocation.

The proposal can be found as [vscode.proposed.lmTools.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.lmTools.d.ts). Note that it is still under active development and that things will change also expect VS Code to ship with reasonable default tools.


## Engineering

### Decouple NLS from AMD loader

This iteration we started to break our dependency of the core NLS support in VS Code with the AMD loader we ship. Our goal in the future is to use ESM loading and drop AMD entirely and to make progress into this direction, we remove our AMD loader plugin dependencies. You should not notice any difference in behaviour and all of the translations we used to support are still supported both in web and desktop.


## Notable fixes

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
