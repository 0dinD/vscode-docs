## Accessibility

### Accessible View for editor hover

To improve accessibility when coding, the [Accessible View](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/accessibility#_accessible-view) and [accessibility help menu](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/accessibility#_accessibility-help) can now the content of the editor hover information. Depending on the focused part of the hover, they show information about the focused part or the entire hover content.

![Accessible View showing the contents of the editor hover information.](images/1_91/accessible-view-hover.png)

### Link underlines

To make links easier to distinguish from regular text in the workbench, you can enable the setting <code codesetting="accessibility.underlineLinks">accessibility.underlineLinks</code> to underline links.

![The run and debug view showing a mix of regular text and underlined links.](images/1_91/underline-links.png)

## Workbench

### Search

We have added a new setting <code codesetting="search.ripgrep.maxThreads">search.ripgrep.maxThreads</code> that enables you to limit the number of threads that the ripgrep search engine uses. This setting applies regardless whether search is used by the core product or via the extension API. Set <code codesetting="search.ripgrep.maxThreads">search.ripgrep.maxThreads</code> to a non-zero value to configure the number of threads. Please be cautious when using this setting, as fixing this to a specific value may slow down ripgrep.

### Adjust allowed encodings for guessing

With the new setting <code codesetting="files.candidateGuessEncodings>files.candidateGuessEncodings</code> you can configure a set of encodings that should be considered when <code codesetting="files.autoGuessEncoding">files.autoGuessEncoding</code> is enabled. The order of configuration determines the priority. This functionality enables you to limit the possible encodings that can be detected to a smaller set and to prioritize one encoding over another.

### Profiles Editor (experimental)

In this milestone, we have introduced a new Profiles Editor that enables you to manage [profiles](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/profiles) from a single location. This includes creating new profiles, editing and deleting existing profiles, and importing and exporting profiles to share with others. While creating a new profile, you can preview the profile and customize as needed before saving it. The Profiles Editor also enables you to open new windows with a specific profile, or set a profile as the default profile for new windows.

![Profiles Editor](images/1_91/profiles-editor.png)

The Profiles Editor is available as an experimental feature behind the <code codesetting="workbench.experimental.enableNewProfilesUI">workbench.experimental.enableNewProfilesUI</code> setting. Once enabled, you can access the Profiles Editor from the Settings gear icon in the bottom left corner of the window.

![Profiles Editor Action](images/1_91/profiles-editor-action.png)

Please give it a try and give us feedback on how we can improve it further.

### New Window with Profile menu item

In addition to the Profiles Editor, we have added actions to the File menu to open a new window with a specific profile. Use the **File** > **New Window with Profile** menu to open a new window with a specific profile.

![New Window with Profile Actions](images/1_91/profile-new-window-actions.png)

### More extension install actions

You can now install an extension without syncing it, or install a specific version of an extension even before installing it. These actions are available in the context menu of the extension in the Extensions view.

![More Extension Install Actions](images/1_91/extension-install-actions.png)

### Access file extensions in custom labels

When you define [custom labels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_customize-tab-labels), you have now more flexibility to access individual file extensions by using the `${extname(N)}` syntax. Additionally, `${extname(N)}` also supports negative indices to capture file extensions in the reverse order. To get the entire file extension, use `${extname}`.

For example, for the file `tests/editor.test.ts`:

- `${filename}` => `editor`
- `${extname}` => `test.ts`
- `${extname(0)}` => `ts`
- `${extname(1)}` => `test`
- `${extname(-1)}` => `test`
- `${extname(-2)}` => `ts`

### Enable multiple extensions to contribute custom label patterns

When two extensions contribute a default configuration for the setting <code codesetting="workbench.editor.customLabels.patterns">workbench.editor.customLabels.patterns</code> in their `configurationDefaults`, the contributed patterns are merged together.

<table style="width: 100%;">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre><code>"workbench.editor.customLabels.patterns" : {
  "**/app/**/page.tsx": "${dirname} - Page",
  "**/app/**/layout.tsx": "${dirname} - Layout"
}</code></pre>
    </td>
    <td>
    <pre><code>"workbench.editor.customLabels.patterns" : {
  "**/components/**/index.tsx": "${dirname} - Component"
}</code></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">Default Contribution by Extension 1</td>
    <td align="center">Default Contribution by Extension 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table style="width: 100%;">
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center;">
      <pre style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;"><code>"workbench.editor.customLabels.patterns" : {
  "**/app/**/page.tsx": "${dirname} - Page",
  "**/app/**/layout.tsx": "${dirname} - Layout",
  "**/components/**/index.tsx": "${dirname} - Component"
}</code></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">Resulting Custom Label Patterns</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Unset a theme color

If a theme sets a color or border that you don't like, you can now use `default` to set it back to the original value:

```json
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
      "diffEditor.removedTextBorder": "default"
  }
```

### Change folding placeholder color

The folding placeholer (elipsis) can now be themed with the color `editor.foldPlaceholderForeground`.

## Editor

### Code Actions on Save improvements

The setting <code codesetting="editor.codeActionsOnSave">editor.codeActionsOnSave</code> now has improved IntelliSense, which provides a list of available Code Actions on Save based on the files in the workspace and the extensions that are activated.

> **Note**: be aware that that although `true` and `false` are still valid configurations at the moment, they will be deprecated in favor of `explicit`, `always`, and `never`. See [Code Actions on Save Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-refactoring#_code-actions-on-save) for examples.

## Source Control

### Incoming/Outgoing changes graph (experimental)

We have been exploring using an alternative visualization of the incoming and outgoing changes. This milestone includes an experimental feature that uses a graph to visualize the incoming and outgoing changes. The graph contains the current branch, the current branch's upstream branch, and an optional base branch. The root of the graph is the common ancestor of these branches.

You can enable this new visualization by using the <code codesetting="scm.experimental.showHistoryGraph">scm.experimental.showHistoryGraph</code> setting. Give it a try and let us know what you think, as we continue to improve and expand the functionality available in this visualization.

![Source control view showing a graph visualization of the incoming and outgoing changes.](images/1_91/incoming-outgoing-changes.png)

## Notebooks

### Find in text selection

<!-- TODO: Michael -->

### Copy or open text output from the context menu

When working with text output in Notebooks, you can now use the context menu of a text output to copy the output value or to open the output in a new editor. This makes it easier to review large streaming outputs.

## Languages

### TypeScript 5.5

We now include TypeScript 5.5. This major update brings a number of new language features and tooling improvements. Check out the [TypeScript 5.5 blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-5/) for details on this release.

### Syntax checking for regular expressions

Thanks to TypeScript 5.5, we now report many syntax errors in JavaScript and TypeScript regular expression literals. This includes errors such as unclosed groups, incorrect back references, or invalid escapes:

![An error for an invalid group caused by an extra paren](images/1_91/ts-regexp-invalid-group.png)

![An error for an invalid escape sequence](images/1_91/ts-new-escape-from-regexp-error.png)

## Contributions to extensions

### GitHub Copilot

#### Compact Inline Chat

Inline chat rendering is now more compact, which makes it easier to read and understand suggestions. We are also experimenting with a more narrative style for the button text that you can enable via <code codesetting="inlineChat.experimental.textButtons:true">inlineChat.experimental.textButtons</code>.

![Sample of more compact inline chat](images/1_91/inline-chat.png)

### Python

#### Python environment discovery using python-environment-tools

We are excited to introduce a new tool, [python-environment-tools](https://github.com/microsoft/python-environment-tools), designed to significantly enhance the speed of detecting global Python installations and Python virtual environments. This tool uses Rust to ensure a rapid and accurate discovery process.

We are currently testing this new feature, running it in parallel with the existing support, to evaluate the new discovery performance in the Python extension. Consequently, you will see a new logging channel called `Python Locator` that shows the discovery times with this new tool.

This enhancement is part of our ongoing efforts to optimize the performance and efficiency of Python support in VS Code. Visit the [python-environment-tools repo](https://github.com/microsoft/python-environment-tools) to learn more about this feature, ongoing work, and provide feedback.

#### Smart Send in native REPL

The Python extension has now enabled [Smart Send](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-november-2023-release/#improvements-to-shift-enter-run-line-in-terminal) in the [VS Code native REPL](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-june-2024-release/#vs-code-native-repl-for-python-with-intellisense-and-syntax-highlighting).

Previously, when you placed your cursor on a line of Python code and pressed `kbstyle(Shift+Enter)`, the Python extension would send the exact line contents to the native REPL, even if it would fail, for example because it's part of a multi-line command.

Now, `kbstyle(Shift+Enter)` sends minimum executable code in a non-nested scenario, or the highest top-level block of code in a nested scenario. This enables users to quickly `kbstyle(Shift+Enter)` throughout their file to run the maximum amount of executable code with the least amount of effort.

#### Support for reStructuredText docstrings

Pylance now has support for rendering reStructuredText documentation strings (docstrings) on hover!

This feature is in its early stages and is currently behind a flag as we work to ensure it handles various Sphinx, GoogleDoc, and Epytext scenarios effectively. To try it out, you can enable the experimental setting <code codesetting="python.analysis.supportRestructuredText:true">python.analysis.supportRestructuredText</code>.

![Docstring displayed when hovering over the panel module](images/1_91/pylance-restructuredtext.png)

Try this change out, and report any issues or feedback at the [Pylance GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/).

> **Note**: this setting is experimental and will likely be removed in the future, as we stabilize this new feature and enable it by default.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

### ESLint

The ESLint extension now supports the [flat config file format](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files). The extension still supports `eslintrc` files and you can use the <code codesetting="eslint.useFlatConfig">eslint.useFlatConfig</code> setting to control which configuration file format is used.

Consult the [ESLint Flat Config rollout plan](https://eslint.org/blog/2023/10/flat-config-rollout-plans/) to understand ESLint's plan for deprecating and removing support for the `eslintrc` file format.

## Preview Features


## Extension authoring

### Chat and Language Model API

Last month, we finalized the APIs that enable extensions to participate in chat and to access language models, but they were only available in VS Code Insiders. In this release, these APIs are now fully available in VS Code Stable.

Check out our [announcement blog post](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2024/06/24/extensions-are-all-you-need) to learn more about these APIs and see how some of early adopters are using them.

To get started, head over to our [extension sample](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/main/chat-sample) and the [Chat extensibility documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/chat).

### Improved Handling of Contributed Default Values for Object Settings

When multiple extensions contribute default values for the same object setting, these default values will now be combined. This prevents conflicts between the extensions.

## Proposed APIs

### Tools and functions for language models

We have added an API proposal that enables tools or functions calling. The API comes with two major parts:

1. Give extensions the ability to register a "tool". A tool is a piece of functionality that is meant to be used by language models. For example, reading the Git history of a file.

2. The mechanics for language models to support tools, such as: extensions passing tools when making a request, language models requesting a tool invocation, and extensions communicating back the result of a tool invocation.

The proposal can be found as [vscode.proposed.lmTools.d.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vscode-dts/vscode.proposed.lmTools.d.ts).

> **Note**: The API is still under active development and things will change. Also expect VS Code to ship with reasonable default tools.

## Engineering

### Decouple NLS from AMD loader

This milestone, we started to break our dependency of the core native language support (NLS) in VS Code with the AMD loader we ship. Our goal in the future is to use ECMAScript Modules (ESM) loading and drop AMD entirely. To make progress into this direction, we remove our AMD loader plugin dependencies. You should not notice any difference in behaviour, and all of the translations we used to support are still supported both in web and desktop.

## Notable fixes

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big _**Thank You**_ to the contributors of VS Code.
