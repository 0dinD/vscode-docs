Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the March 1.55 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the March milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[March iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/118334)** - Review what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22March+2021%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Engineering

### Progress on Electron sandbox

This milestone we continued to make the VS Code window ready for enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/sandbox-option) and [context isolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation) features.

Specifically:

* We were able to move some of the native module requirements we have in the renderer to other processes.
* We were able to make more components and services available when sandbox option is enabled.

## Extension authoring

### Untitled file API for custom editors & notebooks

Custom editors and notebooks now include an `untitledDocumentData` property on the open context which includes the buffer of the data included in the untitled file that the user triggered a "Reopen With" on. This should be read instead of the URI if populated as the URI doesn't point to a file on disk in the untitled file case.

## Notable fixes

* [74505](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/74505): Emmet built-in plugin cheats starting with @ expand only inside blocks
* [97632](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/97632): Emmet kicks in when editing pure xml documents
* [112675](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/112675): Emmet abbreviations are not working in .scss files
* [113801](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/113801): Tab wrap - tab should not fill all spare space when wrap to new line
