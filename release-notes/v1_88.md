### Custom Editors Support for Floating Windows

We expanded support for opening editors into floating windows to custom editors and generally all editors that leverage the [webview API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview), including markdown preview, browser preview and complex custom editors such as our [hex editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.hexeditor).

Highlights include:

## Contributions to extensions

### VS Code Speech

#### Lazy Activation

The extension will now only activate when voice-to-text services are required in VS Code. This ensures that the extension is not negatively impacting the extension host startup time.

#### New `auto` for `accessibility.voice.speechLanguage`

For the `accessibility.voice.speechLanguage` setting, `auto` is the new default. In this mode, the VS Code speech extension will follow the display language of VS Code and pick the right model if supported.
