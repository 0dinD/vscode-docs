## Accessibility


## Workbench

### Custom Editors Support for Floating Windows

We expanded support for opening editors into floating windows to custom editors and generally all editors that leverage the [webview API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview), including markdown preview, browser preview and complex custom editors such as our [hex editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.hexeditor).

### Test Coverage

This iteration we've finalized our Test Coverage API, bringing native coverage support to VS Code. If your testing system support it, you can get coverage using the new **Run With Coverage** button:

![](./images/1_88/run-with-coverage.png)

There are similarly new commands for running with coverage, such as `kbstyle(Ctrl+; Ctrl+Shift+A)` to run all tests with coverage, and `kbstyle(Ctrl+; Ctrl+Shift+L)` to run your last set of tests with coverage.

Coverage information is shown as an overlay on line numbers by default, but you can **Toggle Inline Coverage** to see complete detailed information for your source files:

_Theme: [Codesong](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.codesong) (preview on [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/editor/theme/connor4312.codesong))_

Using test coverage requires that your extension implements the new API. Some extensions, such as the [Test Runner for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-test) and the [node:test runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.nodejs-testing) already support it. Extension authors can find more details about it in the [Testing API documentation](/api/extension-guides/testing#test-coverage).


### Color Code Support in Test Messages

We now parse terminal color codes to colorize textual test messages, such as those displayed when a test fails, rather than displaying the raw 'unprintable' data codes.

## Languages


## Remote Development

The [Remote Development extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack), allow you to use a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), remote machine via SSH or [Remote Tunnels](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels), or the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl) (WSL) as a full-featured development environment.

Highlights include:

- TODO: add remote highlights here

You can learn more about these features in the [Remote Development release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/remote-release-notes/v1_88.md).


## Contributions to extensions

### VS Code Speech

#### Lazy Activation

The extension will now only activate when voice-to-text services are required in VS Code. This ensures that the extension is not negatively impacting the extension host startup time.

#### New `auto` for `accessibility.voice.speechLanguage`

For the `accessibility.voice.speechLanguage` setting, `auto` is the new default. In this mode, the VS Code speech extension will follow the display language of VS Code and pick the right model if supported.
