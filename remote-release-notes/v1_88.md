# March 2024 (version 1.88)

## Core

### Alternate server download for extended support distros

We have now separate server downloads for [extended support distro](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/faq/old-linux) which will have dependency of glibc >= 2.17 and libstdc++ >= 3.4.19. For other distro connections, server with a dependency of glibc >= 2.28 and libstdc++ >= 3.4.25 will be downloaded.

## Dev Containers

### Automatic start of Docker

When the Dev Containers extension detects that Docker is not running on Windows or Mac, it will now check for and automatically start Docker Desktop. This should avoid a common manual step after rebooting your machine.

## Tunnels

Windows administrators can now restrict access to Dev Tunnels and port forwarding via group policies. Read more on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/policies).

## SSH

### New "Exec Server" Mode for SSH

We've been reworking the internals of the `Remote - SSH` extension to a new model. While there are no user-facing changes yet, this release makes the exec server mode the default. If you experience new issues with SSH, you can try disabling this mode by setting `"remote.ssh.useExecServer": false` in your user settings.

Please be sure to [file an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/new) if you run into any such problems.

## WSL
