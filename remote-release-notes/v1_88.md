### New "Exec Server" Mode for SSH

We've been reworking the internals of the `Remote - SSH` extension to a new model. While there are not user-facing changes yet, this release makes the exec server mode the default. If you experience new issues with SSH, you can try disabling this mode by setting `"remote.ssh.useExecServer": false` in your user settings. Please be sure to [file an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/new) if you run into any such problems.
