## Core

## Dev Containers

## Tunnels

Windows administrators can now restrict access to Dev Tunnels and port forwarding via group policies. Read more on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/policies).

## SSH

### New "Exec Server" Mode for SSH

We've been reworking the internals of the `Remote - SSH` extension to a new model. While there are no user-facing changes yet, this release makes the exec server mode the default. If you experience new issues with SSH, you can try disabling this mode by setting `"remote.ssh.useExecServer": false` in your user settings.

Please be sure to [file an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/new) if you run into any such problems.
